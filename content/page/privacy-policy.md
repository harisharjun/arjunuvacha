## About Privacy Policy

This blog, Arjun Uvacha (“Arjun Uvacha”, “the blog”, “the website”, “the product”, “the site”, “the platform”, “we”), is a personal blog maintained by K Harish Arjun (“owner”, “I”, “me”, “my”, myself”). The thoughts, views, ideas, comments, rhetorics, observations, remarks, opinions, reflections, judgements and discussions are my own.

This Privacy Policy is applicable to data subjects within the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Therefore, this Policy is drafted to comply with the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”).

For the purposes of compliance with the GDPR, we are the data controller of information we collect from data subjects through the Services. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “data subject” means an identified or identifiable natural person located in the EEA.

Unless we link to a different policy or state otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies when you visit or use the website or related services (the “Services”).

Parts of the Services let you post comments or participate in discussions on the website publicly, including by asking or answering questions. Such shared content is collected and may be publicly viewable by others depending on where it is posted.

If you access or use our Services through a third-party platform or service, or click on any third-party links, the collection, use, and sharing of your data will also be subject to the privacy policies and other agreements of that third party.

The ads can be based on your recent activity or activity over time and across other sites and services and may be tailored to your interests.

## Cookies
**What are cookies?**\
Cookies are small text files stored by your browser as you browse the internet. They can be used to collect, store, and share data about your activities across websites, including on Arjun Uvacha Services. Cookies also allow us to remember things about your visits to Arjun Uvacha Services, like your preferred language, and to make the site easier to use.

We use both session cookies, which expire after a short time or when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which remain stored in your browser for a set period of time. We use session cookies to identify you during a single browsing session, like when you log into Arjun Uvacha Services.

**Why does Arjun Uvacha use cookies and similar technologies?**\
We use cookies and similar technologies like web beacons, pixel tags, or local shared objects (“flash cookies”), to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways. We use these cookies when you visit our site and services through a browser. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional data through other methods.

We use cookies for the following purposes:
* To remember data about your browser and your preferences
* To remember your settings and other choices you’ve made
    * For example, cookies help us remember your preferred language or the country you’re in, so we can provide content in your preferred language without asking each time you visit.
* Analytics and Research
    * To help us improve and understand how people use Arjun Uvacha Services
For example, cookies help us test different versions of Arjun Uvacha to see which features or content users prefer, web beacons help us determine which email messages are opened, and cookies help us see how you interact with Arjun Uvacha’s Services, like the links you click on.
* We also work with analytics partners, including Google Analytics, who use cookies and similar technologies to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the sites from which you arrive. Those service providers may either collect that data themselves or we may disclose it to them. You can opt out of some of these services through tools like the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On.
* Advertising
    * To provide you with more relevant advertising
    * Please note that where advertising technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive advertising on other websites and applications, but it will not be tailored to your interests. To learn more about targeting and advertising cookies and how you can opt-out, visit Www.Allaboutcookies.Org/Manage-Cookies/Index.Html, or if you’re located in the European Union, visit the Your Online Choices Site.

**What are my privacy options?**\
You have a number of options to control or limit how we and our partners use cookies:

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to decline cookies by consulting your browser’s support articles. If you decide to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some interactive features in the Services.
Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, so your browser’s cookie-management tools may not remove them.

To get information and control cookies used for tailored advertising from participating companies, see the consumer opt-out pages for the Network Advertising Initiative and Digital Advertising Alliance, or if you’re located in the European Union, visit the Your Online Choices Site. To opt out of Google Analytics’ display advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, visit the Google Ads Settings Page.
