&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years of working as a Product Manager, I have realised that a Product Manager needs to have a good grasp and control over a lot of things which cannot be left to chance. Doing this, with multiple stakeholders, a variety of user problems, and a bunch of different types of users is a nightmare if you are not equipped sufficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to help other Product Managers or aspiring Product Managers, I have compiled a list of tools that I have benefitted from, which I think will benefit you also. This list of top Product Management tools, I believe, would help you improve your work. If you are looking for tools that help you be more effective at work, continue reading…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: I will publish another list of tools that would help you propel your personal growth. Keeping watching this space!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, getting on with this one then&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the ease of understanding, I have divided the tools as per the typical product development process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discover&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideate / Brainstorm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prototype&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Launch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way of categorising the tools will help you understand how each tool fits in the entire product development process and also easily identify tools for any specific step that you are struggling with and need immediate help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;discover&#34;&gt;Discover&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a Product Manager, you could indulge in different ways of discovering user problems and pain points: face-to-face user interviews, online user interviews, surveys, market research, data analysis etc. I have suggested a few tools for conducting user interviews, and surveys and organizing the findings. The other ways of discovering - market research and data analysis - are very broad and I have left them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;user-interviews&#34;&gt;User interviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;calendly&#34;&gt;Calendly&lt;/h4&gt;

&gt;
Calendly lets you create your availability schedule on a calendar and share it with prospective users, who can then block a slot on your calendar for user interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also set up multiple schedules, each with a different goal and for a different user segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schedule 1: Understanding user persona: 15min slots, 2 PM to 6 PM every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schedule 2: Problem deep-dive: 1hr slots, 11 AM to 2 PM on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each type of schedule, you get a unique URL which you can share with your target users and they can block your slots as per their availability!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Calendly &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://calendly.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;surveys&#34;&gt;Surveys&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;typeform&#34;&gt;Typeform&lt;/h4&gt;

&gt;
When it comes to surveys, I think Typeform is one of the best services out there. It is simple, intuitive, and easy to create/launch surveys. I have used other services like Survey Monkey, but I find Typeform to be much more user-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Typeform &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.typeform.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;online-user-interviews&#34;&gt;Online user interviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many times, you may not be able to do a user interview by meeting the person face-to-face due to geographical constraints or simply because you don’t have time. Though meeting in person brings a lot of credibility to the user interviews, you can make use of online meeting tools to conduct online user interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;zoom&#34;&gt;Zoom&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/16-product-management-tools-that-will-make-your-life-easy/zoom.png&#34;

&gt;
Zoom is now widely adopted after the Covid pandemic and is one of the easy-to-use services when it comes to online meetings. Zoom lets you record and save the meeting as well, which will be very handy when you want to refer to the conversation after the meeting is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to conduct short 30 min or 45 min user interviews then Zoom is FREE. The FREE version allows meetings for up to 45 min. If you want to conduct longer meetings then you would have to purchase a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Zoom &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://zoom.us/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;google-meet&#34;&gt;Google Meet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/16-product-management-tools-that-will-make-your-life-easy/googlemeet.png&#34;

&gt;
Another alternative here is Google Meet. It is FREE and does not have any time limitation per meeting. However, you cannot record the meetings in the FREE version! But hey, you can do a screen recording and audio recording of the conversation if don’t want to get the paid version. And I recommend you get the paid version, as working with screen recordings and audio recordings is very clumsy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Google Meet &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://meet.google.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;organising-the-research&#34;&gt;Organising the research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is one thing to conduct user interviews, market research and data analysis, and an altogether different things to organise the research to gather insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I don’t sound too simplistic, I use very simple and easily available tools for my organisation and prioritisation of user problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;google-drive&#34;&gt;Google Drive&lt;/h4&gt;

&gt;
Yes, you read it right! The first one is Google Drive!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Drive lets you store all your user interviews, market research and data in one place. You can create folders and categorise the research as per your need and refer to them whenever you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I label all my user interview recordings, survey findings, and market research documents in a proper referencable manner and upload them on Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having everything on Google Drive also helps me share my research with others very easily! So, the collaboration also becomes effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;google-sheets&#34;&gt;Google Sheets&lt;/h4&gt;

&gt;
After you gather enough details about your users and their problems, the only thing left for you to do is identify the most critical problems. And having a list of all the problems in one place where you can collaborate with others is sufficient to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used Google Sheets for a very long time now and this does this job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You list all the problems, invite other folks from the design and engineering and call for brainstorming. Add more columns to mark the weights in terms of design challenges, engineering challenges, and perceived value to the user. With this information, you can see which all items need your attention and when - giving you some sight into the roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ideate-or-brainstorm&#34;&gt;Ideate or brainstorm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to brainstorming, I think nothing beats brainstorming in person. Or I haven’t come across any tool that is good enough for all three departments, Product, Design and Engineering to brainstorm together online!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;design&#34;&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design process could be simply broken into two parts:
Low-fidelity designing or wireframing
High-fidelity designing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;wireframing&#34;&gt;Wireframing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, I realised that it is easier to convey things by drawing them rather than by writing them. I mean, a picture is worth a thousand words, right? So, wireframing is very important, hence it calls for a good wireframing tool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;balsamiq&#34;&gt;Balsamiq&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/16-product-management-tools-that-will-make-your-life-easy/balsamiq.png&#34;

&gt;
I have used Balsamiq for over 5 years now and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to make low-fidelity designs. They have launched Balsamiq Wireframes recently which comes with a 1-month trial period, after which you need to purchase a cloud subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the older one, Balsamiq Mockups (for which they stopped support) is still FREE. And I think Balsamiq Mockups is still good and does a decent job of getting out some basic sketches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Balsamiq &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://balsamiq.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;high-fidelity-designing&#34;&gt;High-fidelity designing&lt;/h3&gt;

&gt;
There are a good number of design software in the market: Figma, Sketch, Adobe InDesign etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I worked with Figma and InDesign. With what I have experienced, I would recommend Figma as I feel it is easier to collaborate, share ideas and work on the go using Figma.
In fact, I use Figma for a lot of my personal works as well - from creating pictographs to company logos to email templates and the best thing is it’s FREE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you want to collaborate with others in the team then you need to get a paid version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;prototype&#34;&gt;Prototype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Figma allows you to create prototypes from the design interfaces you have created. This is particularly important because it is an easy, no-code, less engineering effort way to get the complete experience of the actual product. You can take this prototype out to the real-world users and ask them to try it out and gather feedback and incorporate further changes if required before you push it off to engineering. This saves a lot of time, effort and rework by the engineering team!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidenote: Figma was acquired by Adobe, the maker of InDesign! So, either Figma or InDesign, you would be using an Adobe product!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Figma &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.figma.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;build-the-product&#34;&gt;Build the product&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important job for me as a Product Manager after the prototype is tested is to get it developed by the engineering team. And be on top of things and ensure that the timelines are met. This is nothing but essentially project management and I cannot run away from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a good number of tools to do this, especially in the software products space. I would recommend a couple of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jira&#34;&gt;Jira&lt;/h3&gt;

A well know name, Jira is of the most widely used software product management tools that enable managing the deliverables by various engineering and QA folks after the requirements are frozen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there are multiple developers and QAs involved in building one product, managing their day-to-day tasks and tracking them could get tedious, and Jira does a decent job of making it as simple as possible. As Jira is one of the earliest tools there are many functionalities it has that you won’t find in other Project Management tools that could be used for planning, tracking and delivering a product.&lt;/p&gt;

Another Project Management tool that we used in our Startup was Trello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t worked on Trello for larger projects with many members working together, but during our startup, it was our only project management tool and I can say that it is a neat and clean tool and does a very good job in managing the tasks by multiple stakeholders. Though our was a team of 4 at our startup, Trello could be used for larger team sizes as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Trello &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://trello.com/home&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidenote: Trello was acquired by Atlassian, the maker of Jira!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;product-launch&#34;&gt;Product launch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product launches could be done either by doing a controlled release (also called a Beta release or A/B testing) to a set of users or by releasing the product to all users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For A/B testing (of web pages), there are multiple tools which offer A/B testing functionalities. The top one that I have come across is Optimizely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;optimizely&#34;&gt;Optimizely&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/16-product-management-tools-that-will-make-your-life-easy/optimizely.png&#34;

&gt;
You can use Optimizely to split your traffic to the A version (typically the old version) and B version (the new version) and validate if the new page is performing any better than the old version. You can create a variety of Optimizely experiments for your web pages using the dynamic or basic features that come with the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hassle-free to integrate and presents multiple options around targeting and prioritising the audiences, duration of the test run, and APIs for direct integration and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Optimizely &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.optimizely.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the product is launched (or is ready for launch), product marketing becomes very crucial in taking it to the users. Product marketing is a subject in itself. Keeping it simple, I will just focus on the tools used for online marketing - especially through email and Push Notifications. (Note that there are many other online and offline channels of marketing: SMS, WhatsApp, blog posts, social media posts, news articles, TV, Radio etc which I am leaving out here.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For email/push notifications, a few suggestions are Mailchimp and Hubspot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mailchimp&#34;&gt;Mailchimp&lt;/h3&gt;

&gt;
Probably the widely known name in email marketing. Mailchimp offers templates, and tools to create new templates, and provides analytics support around email open rates, and click rates, with quick and easy integration support. If you are setting up a personal brand or a small-sized business then this might be for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Mailchimp &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mailchimp.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;

HubSpot offers a variety of services: CRM, marketing automation, sales automation, and customer service platform. You can email support as part of its marketing automation toolkit, but it might be too costly for you if you want to take only one service here. Hubspot is generally preferred for the gamut of services it offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find HubSpot &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.hubspot.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analyse&#34;&gt;Analyse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the product is out there in the market, in the hands of the users, you need to figure out if the product is meeting its objectives, analyse whether the users are consuming the product as expected, or figure out if there are any issues that arose after the product launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, multiple tools offer this service and there are many good tools as well. So, choose as you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;google-analytics&#34;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;

Among the many products in its portfolio, Google Analytics is one such product that is used by almost everyone I know in the Product and Technology space. From giving the basic insights around unique page views, unique users, and duration on the page, it gives more nuanced information about user acquisition channels and other engagement metrics with an option to slice and dice the data across multiple user and product dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your Analytics is integrated with Google Ads and Google Adsense, you can get insights around the Ad Spend for customer acquisition or money made from Ads on your web/App as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mixpanel&#34;&gt;Mixpanel&lt;/h3&gt;

&gt;
I used Mixpanel when I was at Phable care. And there are so many reasons why I like it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is one of the very few intuitive Analytics tools I have come across. You can build regular insights reports, funnel reports, or retention reports in just a few clicks - without any training! You can create project-based dashboards and have multiple reports in each dashboard. Download the data easily and also schedule report emailers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you start using it, there won’t be any going back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Mixpanle &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://mixpanel.com/home/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hotjar&#34;&gt;Hotjar&lt;/h3&gt;

&gt;
One primary use case I find tools like Hotjar (or Smartlook) solve is the ease of doing Landing Page analysis. It gives you a Heatmap of the page you want to analyse showing which part of the page is the user most attentive to and how deep in the page is the user scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also records the screen while the user is on the page and saves them as anonymous recordings, which you can view to observe the patterns and user behaviours on the landing pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps in getting a quick view of how the user navigates on the page, validating whether the primary CTA is actually acting as a Primary CTA or not, or after which step is the user dropping off from the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find Hotjar &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.hotjar.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;take-feedback&#34;&gt;Take feedback&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would suggest spending more time talking to customers - either through phone calls or video calls or even better, doing face-to-face meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or talk to the sales team, and ask for very honest feedback - asking them to share recordings of user interactions will help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes talking to the customer support executives or looking at the support tickets or escalations also gives a lot of insights into how the users have received the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, if you think user surveys would do the job, go for Typeforms to create surveys and send them to users via email. You can, in fact, embed the Typeform links inside the product itself, so that once the user completes any significant action or event, you trigger the Typeform seeking user feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are some of the many online tools that are available. There could be better alternatives than what I have mentioned here and I would always like to know about them, please share them.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to identify the right problems to solve?</title>

        <pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2023 19:00:10 +0530</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/how-to-identify-the-right-problems-to-solve/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/how-to-identify-the-right-problems-to-solve/right-problems.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How to identify the right problems to solve?" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Product Managers, our primary responsibility is to solve user problems and make the user’s life easy. More often than not, we are tasked to deal with one or the other complex problem with a lot of nuances, made up of smaller interconnected problems making it a complex web to address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, look at the following problem statement: &lt;strong&gt;Increase the monthly revenue from the &amp;lsquo;Electronics&amp;rsquo; product category of an e-commerce website by 10%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a vague problem to work on. But you can get started by asking some questions to understand the problem better, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there enough demand for the products?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does the user journey look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does the conversion funnel look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which channel offers the best scope to improve revenues?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the communication and messaging by the marketing team bang on?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any delivery constraints?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And so on…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are very important questions to answer and we often get swamped with so much data that it gets difficult to identify which ones to pick and work on. How do we deal with such situations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways of doing this is by identifying or breaking the complex problem into multiple smaller sets of tasks or jobs to be done by different stakeholders along the user journey. This will help us look at a set of smaller, easily comprehendible problems rather than a gigantic web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;example&#34;&gt;Example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you look at the user journey of placing an order from the above-discussed product category problem statement, these could be some of the jobs to be done:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify the right target user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Market (or show an Ad) to the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get the user to click on the marketing campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the user register&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show the user what the user wants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the experience smooth for the user to add products to the cart&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a smooth payment/check-out journey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliver the product to the user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-does-this-do&#34;&gt;What does this do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This helps break down complex problems into a series of jobs to be executed (by people) at a granular level. Because each job is at a granular level, it gets easy to identify how difficult is it for the user to do the job. The more the difficulty implies more the problem. And the more the problem more the opportunity to solve. Similarly, if each job is complicated or takes more time or effort by the user, it offers more opportunities to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ok-but-how-does-this-help&#34;&gt;Ok. But, how does this help?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once all the complex problems are broken down into a series of smaller jobs to be done by various stakeholders involved, you will end up with a simple list of jobs. And you can then choose which jobs are ‘worth solving’ based on how difficult they are and what impact they create for the user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helps in breaking the complex problem into granular bits giving better visibility and the ability to prioritise them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unable to follow?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-case-study-from-personal-life&#34;&gt;A case study from personal life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain this by taking a very simple day-to-day scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scenario&#34;&gt;Scenario&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scenario:&lt;/strong&gt; Abhinav is a working professional and he finds it difficult to cook rice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was asked to simplify the cooking experience and make the &lt;em&gt;‘complex problem’&lt;/em&gt; of cooking rice easy, how would I do it? Would I build a washing machine or an electric cooker? How do I decide what needs to be built?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;breaking-down-the-problem&#34;&gt;Breaking down the problem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if I break down this problem for the user (Abhinav), there would be 7 jobs involved as listed below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take one cup of rice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rinse the rice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the rice in a pressure cooker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add two cups of water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the pressure cooker on the stove with low flame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait for 3 whistles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn off the stove&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-outcome-cooked-rice&#34;&gt;The outcome: Cooked rice!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An easy way to make the cooking experience better for Abhinav is by identifying which of those jobs are the most difficult and simplifying them. Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-job-difficulty-impact-matrix&#34;&gt;The job, difficulty, impact matrix&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, let me first create a matrix with four columns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The job to be done&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The category of the job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difficulty in doing the job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The impact created for Abhinav if the job is simplified&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The category column could simply be some way of bucketing/categorising the jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty and impact could be assigned on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being least difficult/impactful and 5 being most difficult/impactful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By doing this, instead of looking at a complex problem, I will now be able to look at a list of categorised tasks, the effort required to perform them and their impact on Abhinav.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have broken these jobs into two categories: Prep and Cook, and assigned their level of difficulty and impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matrix would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/how-to-identify-the-right-problems-to-solve/jobs-with-difficulty-impact.png&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;253&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;607px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can notice that steps 1 to 4 are simple and do not take much effort from Abhinav, hence the difficulty assigned for them is 1. And because Abhinav does not perceive much impact if these steps are solved, the assigned impact also is 1 for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next two steps require Abhinav to handle the pressure cooker correctly, turn on the stove, put it on low flame and wait for 3 whistles - these are burdensome. It calls for the user’s effort, availability and attention. Hence they are assigned higher difficulty points. Solving these steps will make it that much less burdensome for the user, so the impact created for Abhinav also will be much higher if these steps are simplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final step, Step 7, is also of low effort, with a difficulty of 1 point. But it is the closing and an important step. Abhinav has to turn off the stove without fail, if not the rice will be burnt. Though it does not take much effort, it is a must. Now, if this step is solved, then the perceived impact for Abhinav is very high as he does not have to worry about turning off the stove. That’s a great relief and would also allow him to focus on other activities. Hence this job is assigned an impact of 4 points if simplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The total difficulty of the user to cook the rice is 11 points.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adding-the-difficulty-x-impact-column&#34;&gt;Adding the Difficulty x Impact column&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do I make this entire process less difficult?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s add one column to this matrix: Difficulty x Impact = product of difficulty points and impact points. The matrix would look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if I had to choose which jobs to work on, to give a better cooking experience, I would  choose the ones with &lt;strong&gt;High Difficulty and High Impact.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be achieved by looking at the &lt;strong&gt;‘Difficulty x Impact’ column&lt;/strong&gt;, I would get the prioritised jobs as:&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prioritising-the-problems&#34;&gt;Prioritising the problems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, I would like to ensure that:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user doesn’t have to wait&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user doesn’t worry about putting the cooker on the stove with the right flame&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user doesn’t have to worry about turning off the stove&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this, I could ask Abhinav to use an electric cooker instead of a pressure cooker, which solves the top three challenges for him. And below will the steps he would need to follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take one cup of rice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rinse the rice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the rice in a pressure cooker&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add two cups of water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put the rice in an electric cooker (the cooker will turn off automatically)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-outcome-rice-is-cooked&#34;&gt;The outcome: Rice is cooked!&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we look at the matrix again, replacing the pressure cooker with an electric cooker, it would look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/how-to-identify-the-right-problems-to-solve/electric-cooker-matrix.png&#34;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;final-observations&#34;&gt;Final observations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this solution (of using an electric cooker), &lt;strong&gt;the effort has been reduced from 11 points to 5 points,&lt;/strong&gt; with the same outcome in both cases: cooked rice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you notice, I worked on the ‘Cook’ category of the problems, without worrying much about the ‘Prep’ category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, imagine if I had prioritised the ‘Prep’ category and focused on solving steps 2 or 3 or 4: rinsing of rice or automatic measurement of water quantity then I would have proposed using &lt;strong&gt;a washing machine for cooking rice&lt;/strong&gt; (which sounds like a ridiculous idea!) because a washing machine does the best job in solving the rinsing and the measurement problem. However, those steps are not what the user sees as daunting or difficult. So, if I had chosen to solve steps 2, 3, or 4, I would have put all my efforts into solving the &lt;strong&gt;wrong&lt;/strong&gt; problems for the user. And had this solution been proposed and implemented, it would have probably made life even more difficult for Abhinav, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, what I want to convey is, if you break down the complex problem (or process) into minor tasks or jobs, assign them their difficulty and impact, and prioritise based on their difficulty and impact levels, it becomes much clearer (and easier) to pick which parts of the seemingly complex problem to work on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, are you working on building a washing machine or an electric cooker?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Well, think again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. If you found this interesting, please share this with other Product aspirants!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Value of Defaults</title>
        <link>https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/the-value-of-defaults/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2023 16:16:32 +0530</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/the-value-of-defaults/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/the-value-of-defaults/defaults-resized.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Value of Defaults" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lets-start-with-a-story&#34;&gt;Let’s start with a story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently migrated from an Android smartphone to an iPhone. One stark difference I saw between the both of them was in their default settings. This difference was stark yet so subtle that it’s hard to realise unless you pay attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diving into the story… I remember when I was using the Android smartphone I had to follow this routine of going through my notifications at the end of the day, clearing off the irrelevant ones to figure out if anything needed my attention. However, I was often swindled by some irrelevant notification which should not have had my attention. I then, without any intention, spent the next hour or two browsing random Apps which otherwise did not provide any value to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an hour-long unproductive exercise, I used to convince myself that it was probably worth spending that time. “&lt;em&gt;I got relaxed. Great stress-buster&lt;/em&gt;,” I gave false assurance to myself. The particularly impermissible part about this was this happened day after day, every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, after I switched to the iPhone, I spend less time “&lt;em&gt;relaxing&lt;/em&gt;” myself going through irrelevant notifications or browsing unnecessary Apps. I know exactly which notifications need my attention and when. &lt;em&gt;How? you might ask.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-does-iphone-do-it&#34;&gt;How does iPhone do it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quite simple actually. When a new App is installed on an iPhone, the Notifications preference is asked by default. It asks you how you want to receive the notifications from that App and gives you three options to choose from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allow immediately&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This allows the App to deliver the notifications immediately. This could be used for the ones which are important and require your attention immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allow in schedule&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a brilliant notification feature in iPhone, one that I love the most. If this is selected, the notifications will be delivered &lt;strong&gt;only as per the schedule you set&lt;/strong&gt; - like at 8 PM in the night and you won’t be interrupted in the middle of the day. Could be used for the ones which are important but do not need immediate attention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Allow&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This simply does not deliver any notifications from the App. Could be used for the ones that are not important and do not need any immediate attention&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;iphone-and-its-many-defaults&#34;&gt;iPhone and its many defaults&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just for notifications, the iPhone comes with many other default settings which might not even have occurred to the user, but iPhone solves it and that&amp;rsquo;s the beauty of a great product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For example:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Allow location permission’ is disabled by default on iPhone for all Apps. Apps ask for permission before accessing the location. On the contrary, location permission is enabled by default on an Android. So, Android doesn&amp;rsquo;t give location privacy - again for the same reason that nobody wants to take that extra effort to change the default preference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;‘Screentime’ is turned on by default: iPhone calculates the ‘Screentime’ - time spent on each App and gives you a summary of it on a daily/weekly/monthly basis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When an iPhone is put on silent, it does not vibrate too: ‘Vibrate on silent’ is disabled by default&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It automatically turns off the Hotspot, if it is not in use for a long time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If WiFi/Bluetooth are turned off before going to bed, iPhone turns them on by default the next day morning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It suggests a &amp;lsquo;Do Not Disturb setup by default for your sleeping hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-lazy-man--his-mind&#34;&gt;The lazy man &amp;amp; his mind&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default way of asking you to choose any preference ensures that it IS set. It makes the entire exercise of changing settings very smooth and less stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Notifications preference was not set at the time of installation of an App, it most likely won’t be changed later anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking any initiative (changing Notification preferences in this case) comes with a high amount of friction because it requires you to spend your energy. But you, as a human, are inherently wired to conserve energy as part of our evolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You do not exactly know what needs to be done to change the notification settings because neither is it something that you do very often nor are you trained on it. And you don&amp;rsquo;t do it, because you don&amp;rsquo;t know it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third, you subconsciously don’t want to spend your effort on something that snatches away your right to “&lt;em&gt;relaxation&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourth, if you get irrelevant notifications daily from not just one, not just two, but from many Applications, you know that you need to turn off the notification for each one of them! “&lt;em&gt;Turning off notifications for one App itself seems a big task, now you’re asking me to turn them off for all of them? It is not happening. I rather not turn off any&lt;/em&gt;,” thinks the mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking the Notifications preference to be set by default on an iPhone ensures that I go ahead and set the preference. Without this default nudge, I bet, I would have never gone into changing the App notification settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-do-defaults-do-anyway&#34;&gt;What do &amp;lsquo;defaults&amp;rsquo; do, anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These defaults, though very trivial and minute, simplify the things we do every day and that makes THE difference in the long run. It is hard to understand how they help you if you have something by default because you get to do things without much effort, sometimes without you even noticing them and hence you hardly appreciate their value. You generally tend to value something if it was difficult for you, if it was something noticeable or if you had spent a considerable amount of time or money on it. The greater the loss, the greater the perceived value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When something happens by default, you assume that it was ought to happen. You don’t tend to appreciate how difficult it must have been for something to happen by default. You do not realise how different things would have been in the absence of that ‘default.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at an examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;making-life-easy-at-home&#34;&gt;Making life easy at home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was at home in Hyderabad, my mother was the one taking care of the chores, preparing food, ensuring I take care of my health and well-being and doing everything to keep the household together. And now, after marriage, my wife helps me with most of these things though she also is a working employee. (Side note: I am grateful for the women in my life!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I realise the importance and significance of getting these things done by default, without my notice and realisation. Because I know that my stay in Bengaluru was a struggle as a bachelor when these things were not taken care of by default. When things happen by default, you don’t give it a damn. Remove the default and life goes haywire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-the-right-defaults&#34;&gt;Setting the right defaults&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it, is there anything that is happening with you that is making your life easy? You may not realise them immediately, but I am sure there are plenty of things that are happening in your life without your intervention which are keeping your peace of mind. Those are your defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting the right defaults leads to a great design of the product. And the same thing applies to life too. We come across defaults in our day-to-day life also. They go so subdued that they hardly get noticed. But you can take action to set these defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mutual-fund-sips&#34;&gt;Mutual Fund SIPs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we understand the importance of investing and know that if the money is invested properly, we get a good chance of leading a more harmonious life in the long run. However, investing takes time, effort and skill and we seldom do it. But, the default of ‘monthly SIPs in a mutual fund’ comes in as a saviour. You don’t have to break your head and make a decision every month. By subscribing to a SIP, you are setting a default amount to be invested in a mutual fund. Once set, you don’t have to worry about it (unless the market sentiment looks gloomy for many years to come) and it takes care of the investment for you until you figure out more profitable investment avenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lunchtime&#34;&gt;Lunchtime&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example is setting your lunchtime. Earlier, I was not very punctual in having my lunch. I used to get carried away by my work, be stuck in a meeting or work on something without realising that it was getting late. Having lunch at a fixed time was a luxury, it was very rare! Over time (read: getting old 😛) I realised that not having food on time could lead to potential health issues and I had to figure out a way to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I simply set a default for that. I blocked my calendar for 1 PM - 2 PM every day for lunch, this time was blocked for lunch no matter what. With this, I had set a reminder for myself and because my calendar was blocked, my colleagues refrained from setting up a meeting during that time. I had set a default time for my lunch. And, now, more often than not, I have my lunch between the default 1 PM - 2 PM!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-reason-i-love-uber&#34;&gt;The reason I love Uber&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another product example of how setting a default helps is Uber. Let’s say you use Uber to travel to the office daily. It automatically updates the pickup location by default without you entering it. You just need to select the destination location, and even that would be shown in the suggestions (Uber uses your travel history from a given location and suggests the most recent and frequent destinations). All you need to do is just tap on the suggestion and confirm the booking. This simple determination and suggestion of a location by default is one of the main reasons why I am habituated to opening Uber to find a cab. Only if I do not find a cab on Uber do I open any other App. I was so tuned, that a simple default nudge (of showing/selecting a location) made my life easy and helped me form a habit, without my awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same thing is done by Swiggy as well. It picks the default address based on your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-else-can-defaults-do&#34;&gt;What else can defaults do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defaults don’t just make life easy. They are particularly used in high-risk situations which could lead to damage to life or property if enough attention is not paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-abcs-of-a-car&#34;&gt;The ABCs of a car&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the accelerator, the brake and the clutch in a car (the ABCs of a car). Their default positions ensure that torque from the engine is zero, as the accelerator is always in a zero position unless an effort is applied. Similarly, the brake functions such that if more force is applied the car comes to a halt. And the default position of the clutch ensures that the power from the engine is always transmitted to the wheels. Only when the clutch is applied, the transmission stops. Why are their default positions designed that way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look. If either the accelerator or the brake or the clutch were designed oppositely, then their default positions would have resulted in: Accelerator = High, Brakes = Applied, and Clutch = Not transmitting power. This combination is ridiculous because high acceleration when brakes are applied is a contradiction. And having high acceleration as soon as you start the car would make it difficult to control and is life-threatening for you and others. On top, to get the car moving, one would have to do three things together:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press to reduce the acceleration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press to remove the brakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the clutch to transmit the power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three at the SAME TIME!!! That would be impossible and nobody would be driving cars. If it was like that, they would have just been vehicles to perform heroics by professional stuntmen in a circus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ease of operation of a car is due to its default controls. One could easily learn these controls, get training and pay little attention to managing their travel needs. Any change or reverse of these default controls, the car would become a museum product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;minimise-your-losses-if-not-maximising-gains&#34;&gt;Minimise your losses, if not maximising gains&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defaults need to be set to ensure that even if no action is taken it minimises the loss. Make it so easy that if you don’t take any decision about something, the default will ensure that it is good enough and your losses are minimised. You also need to set a default when decision-making is bound to consume time and effort, a lack of which might harm you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything where you don’t want to spend your energy, where the returns do not entice you to put in the effort, set defaults. Defaults ensure that you do not go down, they offer stability and guarantee a minimum promise to be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defaults take a one-time effort, with returns going on for perpetuity till you change them. You will save a lot of headaches by setting defaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix subscription, leaving your car keys on the stand beside your door, automating bill payments, setting an alarm that goes off in the morning - all these are examples of defaults that make your life a tad bit easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-in-it-for-you&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s in it for you?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what default are you going to set today? What value do you see it deliver you?&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How the iPhone disappointed me!</title>
        <link>https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/how-the-iphone-disappointed-me/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 14:10:54 +0530</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/how-the-iphone-disappointed-me/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/how-the-iphone-disappointed-me/iphone.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How the iPhone disappointed me!" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the widespread belief that the iPhone is a product manager’s marvel, I do see some very infuriating features (rather the lack of them) that when I switched from an Android to iPhone, I was disappointed. Not just disappointed, I felt lost, helpless and angry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn’t have bought a new phone had Xiaomi given an Android OS upgrade from Nougat to Oreo, but that was not going to happen. I didn’t mind working on the Nougat OS either but I had just one problem - Slack deprecated its App for the Nougat OS and Slack is our company’s internal communication App! So, in a way, I was forced to buy a new phone. 🤷🏻‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major requirement for me was to have a small and sleek phone. I did not want to carry a bulky, huge, not-fitting-in-my pocket kind of a phone. When I searched the market for a suitable option, iPhone was the only option with smaller screen sizes. It was hard for me to consider iPhone (from Android) as the best option, but I did. I bought the iPhone 12 Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a while for me to get adjusted to the iOS ecosystem, but I got a hang of it in a few days. I love some of the features and use them daily, but I also miss some beautiful and simple features which I enjoyed on my Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not going to talk much about the ‘good’ features here, I just want to vent out my frustration of missing some valuable features which I enjoyed on Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few things that made me regret my decision of buying an iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The battery life is among the poorest in the market. Even one full charge doesn’t come in handy for a day, with modest phone usage. I generally charge my phone thrice in two days&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One very infuriating thing that made me feel completely helpless was the call recording features. As part of my job, I do customer interviews and record conversations for analysis and insights. I enjoyed the auto call recording feature on my Note 4. Not only does the iPhone not have the call recording option, but there are no good options even in the App Store! I searched for various options: good Apps (without issues) or other workarounds for about 4 hours but to no use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The call history is another frustrating thing. iPhone doesn’t store the call history dating long back (it doesn’t display at least). I can hardly see the call history dating back to a few days, that’s it! I cannot see if I have called someone a couple of weeks, I just cannot!! On Android, I could find the entire call history of my contacts - going back even 5 years!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another issue related to calls, iPhone merges all the calls - from WhatsApp, Skype, Signal, FaceTime, regular calls - and shows them in the call history. Many times, when I want to make a regular call I tap the user in the call history and it triggers a WhatsApp call, which is frustrating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have two SIMs on my phone. My outgoing service is active only on one SIM, not on the other and I have set the outgoing SIM as the default SIM for all the outgoing calls. Despite this, if a user calls me on another SIM and I try to call them back, iPhone calls them from this another SIM, not my default SIM. I mean, I made one SIM default so that I do not have to switch SIMs, hello?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The default calculator is another irritating App. Earlier, in the MI Note, I was able to see what my previous calculations were. If I had done a series of operations, say, 14540 x 24 + 13500 x 12 - 100000, then I was allowed to scroll up and see what my previous punched in numbers were. But the iPhone calculator does not even provide a view of what my previous punched in number is, or in fact, what my previous performed operation is!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume you are watching a video on your phone. In any normal Android phone, when you get a notification you can swipe up on the notifcation to hide it (which you can view later), left or right to remove it - you may want to remove the notifcation from the notifications bar because you know it is irrelevant and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to look at it later also. You don&amp;rsquo;t get that ease in an iPhone. You can hide the notification by swiping up. Swiping left or right on the notifcation doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. If you want to kill the notification, you should swipe down on it to expand the notification content and swipe down again to kill it! I just don&amp;rsquo;t understand why a left/right swipe is not allowed!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another issue related to the notifications is that I am not allowed to kill a notification on the notifications bar by a simple right or left swipe. The right swipe opens the App pertaining to that notification. Left swipe shows three actions that I can perform on the notification: Manage, View or Delete. Additionally, tapping on the notification also opens the respective App. So, if I want to open the notification, there are three different ways to do it! Why such redundancy for opening the notification, while no easy way to kill the notification? For me, killing a notification is as equally important as viewing it. And later I discovered that, I can kill a notification by swiping left on the notification from the right most edge to the left most edge which is even more irritating than simply swiping left and clicking on &amp;lsquo;Delete&amp;rsquo;. Why can&amp;rsquo;t the right swipe be used to kill the notification?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will add more to this list as I find other infuriating issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; frustrations when it comes to the iPhone? Do let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that iPhone is a fantastic phone and there is a reason why it is one of the most widely used products in the world. This post only highlights the aspects which I thought were very basic and should be included; &lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll probably do another post talking of its marvellous features.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
That is for some other day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/forer-effect&#34; &gt;Forer effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s get started with this one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s go back to the 1600s for a while and explore a couple of the discoveries back then!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;experiment-from-the-leaning-tower-of-pisa&#34;&gt;Experiment from the Leaning Tower of Pisa&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would have heard of Galileo Galilei. If not, he is the one known for his famous experiment of dropping two objects of different weights from the ‘Leaning Tower of Pisa’. His experiment contradicted what Aristotle had taught before: heavier objects fall faster than the lighter objects. And as the experiment reveals, both the objects hit the ground almost at the same time, busting the popular belief till then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it very intuitive to think that a lighter object will obviously take more time than a heavier object? We experience this phenomenon daily - if a pen and paper slip away from a table, the pen hits the ground first, isn’t it? It is a fact that the pen hits first, but we do not tend to think beyond the easy evidence. The easy evidence is that pen weighs more than the paper, so we correlate the weight of the object to the time taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that is not true. A few experiments (as Galileo and others had done) would reveal that the shape of the object, the density, the buoyancy and air friction determine the time taken, not the weight per se! And this was quite a revelation back then. Due to these and a lot of other discoveries, Galileo would be called the ‘father of modern physics’ by many later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sun-or-earth-which-one-is-the-centre&#34;&gt;Sun or Earth, which one is the centre?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at another work by Galileo that questioned a more popular and widely accepted belief in society - &lt;strong&gt;geocentrism&lt;/strong&gt; (the concept that the &lt;strong&gt;earth&lt;/strong&gt; is at the centre).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contradicting theory is &amp;lsquo;&lt;strong&gt;heliocentrism&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;. Also known as Copernicanism, derived from the name of renowned mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus who first built mathematical models for theoretical explanations, heliocentrism is the astronomical model in which the &lt;strong&gt;Sun&lt;/strong&gt; is at the centre of the universe and the Earth and other planets revolve around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galileo successfully provided physical evidence to explain this phenomenon, but the then community disregarded his claims and forced him to accept that the Earth only was the centre of the universe. And due to this, in 1633, Galileo was ordered to stand trial, was imprisoned for a few years and was then held on house arrest for the rest of his life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But why was it so difficult for people to believe this newly proposed way of the planetary system which has some scientific explanation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You see, in the Catholic world prior to Galileo&amp;rsquo;s conflict, geocentrism agreed with the literal interpretation of the Bible in several places: Chronicles 16:30, Psalm 93:1, Psalm 96:10, Psalm 104:5, Ecclesiastes 1:5 and all the people subscribed to this view as it has got references in the Bible itself. As the connection was established with the Bible, it was hard to contradict this view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would like to highlight two takeaways from the above two anecdotes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;takeaways&#34;&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;from-the-leaning-tower-of-pisa-experiment&#34;&gt;From the leaning tower of Pisa experiment:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A belief could be false no matter how popular or intuitive it is, and it takes rigorous experiments to prove it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;from-the-galileos-story&#34;&gt;From the Galileo&amp;rsquo;s story:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No matter how scientific an experiment and explanation is for a phenomenon, people will not be ready to change their beliefs. In fact, people will be ready to take extreme measures to safeguard their beliefs than try to find out the truth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Galileo doing in an article that is supposed to be on psychology, you wonder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These two anecdotes are only to convey that our beliefs and belief systems are very difficult to understand, difficult to prove and difficult to change. And thus, a lot of what we say, what we do and what we decide are based on these true or false beliefs, knowingly or unknowingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us to what is called a &lt;strong&gt;‘Belief Bias’&lt;/strong&gt;:\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;We judge an argument’s strength not by how strongly it supports the conclusion but by how plausible the conclusion is in our minds.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s look at a couple of my personal experiences around this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-belief-dilemma&#34;&gt;The belief dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lesson-from-my-first-startup&#34;&gt;Lesson from my first startup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first startup was WhatsDplan (more details about this in my earlier article &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/ikea-effect&#34; &gt;IKEA effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;). We started WhatsDdplan because we believed in the idea. And frankly, this belief is good. Without any belief, you wouldn’t achieve anything great. Belief is needed to do something which otherwise would not have been possible. If you want to conquer the moon you need to first believe it and then only will you be able to experience it. But even for that, you need to have a very good grasp of reality and not be drown in a false sense of belief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My assessment about ‘WhatsDplan’, if I recollect some of the discussions I have had with a few investors and also with a few of my friends and colleagues, was riveted around belief and belief alone! Rather than a strong argument on ‘why’ exactly would it work, I thought it will work because ‘WE’ were building it and we were good. We were invested in the idea since the beginning and did not want to doubt it even for a little while. We carried on with a lot of vigour and purpose, and did not want to give up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the startup ended in a tragedy. We had to shut it down after a year-long effort to make it work. We missed a lot of critical observations and assessments which could have helped us pivot and survive. Well, let&amp;rsquo;s save that story for another day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;skewed-beliefs-of-my-friend&#34;&gt;Skewed beliefs of my friend&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I was having a conversation with a friend. He has had a troubled past and was still figuring it out - about his life and career. He has tried his hand at a variety of things, but nothing seemed concrete. He hopped from one thing to another after giving it a try for a short while - from analytics to data science to finance to consulting to starting up. He did 100 different things and lacked focus in all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were having a conversation about what could he possibly do next, he said he wanted to pursue UPSC! I was shocked. He believed that he could just do it because he thought so. There was no strong argument for it. All he said was, ‘because I want to do it, I will do it!’ But I knew that this was another whim he was having. As his past suggested, he struggled to keep focus in getting a job as an analyst itself, I knew, he will not have the focus and dedication required to crack UPSC. But he was just driven by the idea of it without having a credible argument!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t convince him out of it. I am still wondering how do we make someone realise if they are so driven just by their beliefs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I think more about it, I realise that the belief bias is not just seen at a personal level like the above examples. We are exposed to it as a society, as a community and as a global fraternity as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s take a look at some examples&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-age-old-patriarchy&#34;&gt;The age-old patriarchy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me one complete season of Money Heist to realise that patriarchy is ingrained in a lot of things we do on a daily basis. I do not want to go into the details of the heist, but on the face of it, we think we are quite liberal in our thinking and believe that we are not being biased based on gender. But, if we critically assess everything we do on a daily basis, we realise that we have taken so many things for granted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;assuming power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;judging based on gender rather than intellect or physical capacity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;taking unanimous decisions without any consultation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;preconceived roles and responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;entrusting ownership without power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a lot more&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There could be reasons for some of the practices (not the above) that bestow roles for males and females separately in the society, which is good as this furthers our progress as a society. But, many of these practises are simply followed because they are just laid out there, because we have been following them since a long time and for no other reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;buying-a-car-gives-a-good-life&#34;&gt;Buying a car gives a good life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have many friends who believe that having a car gives a good life. Ask them why, and they say &amp;lsquo;a car is needed, no?&amp;rsquo; The argument dies at the beginning itself. There could be many reasons how a car improves the lifestyle (if not life) which is fine, but a deeper thought is not given into these when such a purchase is made. It is bought because ‘we need a car, right?’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-silly-bad-omens&#34;&gt;The silly bad omens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many instances in my childhood when we did a few things just because we believed them to be true! Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at one such incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are three kids in our family - my brother, sister and I. I vividly remember the incident when we had to go to a nearby relative&amp;rsquo;s house. We had to attend a function in the night and had to walk to the relative’s place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘We should not travel in groups of three’, we heard someone tell us, one of our elders. As we were three of us, we believed that it was not good for us to go. But there was a way around, a hack to bypass this! My sister picked up a stone from the ground, put it in the purse and told we were then good to go. We had ‘stone’ as the fourth member, can you believe it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds silly, right? It is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are more:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking into a broken mirror is bad luck. &lt;em&gt;You can judge me, but I am still scared to look into a broken mirror!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A black cat crossing the path is bad luck. &lt;em&gt;Many of you still believe this, right?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;more-examples&#34;&gt;More examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graduating from an IIT gives a good life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Charity is just donating some money to an NGO&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our religion is superior to the other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My responsibility as a citizen is just to cast my vote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-are-our-beliefs-formed&#34;&gt;How are our beliefs formed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of our beliefs are formed because of what we see and perceive from the society, the environment and everything happening around us. We ponder on some, question some, but accept many as they are. We develop some form of intuition with things and how to deal with them. We take them for granted on the face of it. As we develop these beliefs, when we encounter a similar situation and respond to it, we consider it to be valid without critically looking at the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of social conditioning, we are simply said to follow a few things and believe in a few things because it makes life easy or fits someone’s way of how life should be lived, or what leads to a fulfilling life. It may broadly be true, but is not applicable for everyone, in every situation every time. There will be exceptions and we need to embrace those exceptions, for those exceptions and the ability to tread them with required attention separates the bad from the good, and the good from the great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As kids, we believe in what our parents say, our teachers say, our elders say and we carry them with ourselves as we grow. But the world changes with time and so does our ability to understand and assess things. What you were told to be true may not hold good at a later point in time. Hence, it is advised to question the premise of the belief(s) or the belief system itself from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though intuition is good as it helps us decide faster without wasting our precious time and energy, there is one problem: it may not be right always! So, we need to be aware and cautious of how we are coming to some conclusion. And correct ourselves from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though we are required to validate everything, it is practically not possible. Many times, we are forced to learn from others’ experiences. And when learning from others&amp;rsquo; experiences, we need to critically question and assess the conclusion before believing in it. And many times we need to place our belief in a person, not the belief itself. You may not be able to critically assess the situation always but at least be cognizant of the fact that something is believed because &amp;lsquo;&lt;strong&gt;someone&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo; you trust said so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to critically assess and question the existing set of notions and beliefs - sometimes because  we don’t know that our decisions are driven by them and sometimes because we do not want to put ourselves in the struggle of pursuit of truth as &lt;strong&gt;we are lazy and afraid!&lt;/strong&gt; So, it is hard to control our existing belief systems from interfering in our objective decision making. It requires training, a lot of it, just like overcoming any other cognitive bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-avoid-this-bias&#34;&gt;How to avoid this bias?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are a few things that you could do to safeguard yourself from this bias.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look for objective reasons.&lt;/strong&gt; If you think something is true or something is the best thing to do, look for objective reasons why it could be true. Don’t get carried away by the end result just because that seems plausible or intuitive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break the &lt;strong&gt;end result into smaller measurable chunks&lt;/strong&gt; that could be objectively assessed. Assessing smaller pieces is easier compared to assessing the whole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List down all the different &lt;strong&gt;reasons why the belief could be wrong.&lt;/strong&gt; And disprove them! Rather than cherishing why it could be right, focus on why it could be ‘wrong’. Until you find all the reasons why it could not be wrong, you do not believe it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you for reading! 🙏🏼&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;👍🏼 ➡️ If you liked it, please share it with others who might find it interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Land a Product Manager Job?</title>
        <link>https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/how-to-land-a-product-manager-job/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 27 Jun 2021 13:39:38 +0530</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/how-to-land-a-product-manager-job/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/how-to-land-a-product-manager-job/product-interview.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How to Land a Product Manager Job?" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, I was in Sales at Treebo, taking care of a couple of regions in the South. While this role was good, I felt I had a strong passion for problem solving and building products. Though I had a desire to move into Product, neither did I have enough courage to make the move nor did I have interest to start preparing for a new role altogether. I knew, I got complacent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then it happened. Sighting funding reasons, Treebo laid off about 200 of its employees, and I was one of them. I got lucky, I should say! Though it was a bit of a shocker for me, it was a blessing in disguise&amp;hellip; That finally let me try my hand at Product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as a I moved from Sales to Product, the transition was anything but easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landing a PM interview itself was a big hurdle, leave alone getting selected. Nevertheless, with the right attitude and approach to becoming a Product Manager, I was able to make it. It took me about two months to land an interview and a good four months to get selected at Edureka, my first company as a Product Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you too are aspiring to become a Product Manager and are a little lost about how to crack it, below are a few resources you could start with. If I was able to transition from a Sales role to a Product role, you can too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, landing a Product role is not easy. Different companies have different definition of a Product Manager and the expectations and requirements too are different from company to company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this article gives you some direction on how to proceed and know what are the basic things every Product Manager should do, no matter which company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;books-to-read&#34;&gt;Books to Read&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many Product Manager preparatory books out there. Below are a few which I read and found them very useful as a beginner!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decode and Conquer&lt;/strong&gt; by Lewis C Lin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Product Manager Interview&lt;/strong&gt; by Lewis C Lin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cracking the PM Interview&lt;/strong&gt; by Gayle Laakmann and Jackie Bavaro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hooked&lt;/strong&gt; by Nir Eyal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lean Startup&lt;/strong&gt; by Eric Ries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sample-resume-and-cover-letter&#34;&gt;Sample Resume and Cover Letter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would recommend a one-page resume. You can trim your resume by removing all the points which do not add credibility to your profile or amplify your PM skillsets, like &lt;em&gt;your drawing competition award in Grade I!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When mentioning previous work experience, do not write lengthy paragraphs. Just mention the key achievements, key results, key metrics you were able to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;my-resume-for-your-reference-arjuns-resumehttpsdrivegooglecomfiled14iwu6owcol8kmev910ctnwvj0plxv1a-viewuspsharing&#34;&gt;My resume for your reference: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/14IWU6OwcOl8Kmev910cTNwVJ0Plxv1a-/view?usp=sharing&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Arjun&amp;rsquo;s Resume&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have used Novoresume to create mine. It is quite handy. Check it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://novoresume.com/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use my resume as a template. There is no hard and fast rule that your resume should be like mine. This resume is for you to draw some inspiration and tweak yours to create the best version to showcase yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &gt;Cover Letter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all companies ask for a cover letter, but having one could be very handy when sending a detailed application on email or when filling up a registration form on a new job portal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;case-studies-and-assignments&#34;&gt;Case Studies and Assignments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assignments form an important criteria for selection in many companies (especially startups). They help the recruiters guage the potential of the candidate without wasting much of their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good assignment could come a long way in not just clearing the round but also in earning brownie points in case the interview doesn&amp;rsquo;t go very well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few assignments which I did for some of the companies I applied for:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cognitive Biases - Part 06: Forer Effect</title>

&lt;p&gt;😀 Please note that this is the sixth in a series of articles I am writing on Cognitive Biases. If you haven’t read the other five yet, I’d recommend you read them first. &lt;strong&gt;Links below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/confirmation-bias&#34; &gt;Confirmation Bias&lt;/a&gt; ✅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/fundamental-attribution-error&#34; &gt;Fundamental Attribution Error&lt;/a&gt; ✅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/ikea-effect&#34; &gt;Ikea effect&lt;/a&gt; ✅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/availability-heuristic&#34; &gt;Availability Heuristic&lt;/a&gt; ✅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/framing-effect&#34; &gt;Framing effect&lt;/a&gt; ✅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-forer-effect&#34;&gt;What is the Forer effect?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We easily attribute our personalities to vague statements, even if they apply to a wide range of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1948, psychologist Bertram R. Forer conducted an experiment on his students where each student was given a set of statements (about themselves) like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Although you do have some weaknesses, you try very hard to overcome them and be a better person.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You are an independent thinker who takes pride in doing things differently than others.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“You have an intense desire to get people to accept and like you.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Sometimes you give too much effort on projects that don’t work out.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students were then asked to rate how accurately those statements described themselves on a scale of 5. What was surprising was, though the statements were very generic, the average rating of all the students was 4.3/5 which indicated that the students found those statements highly relevant to themselves! Based on the results, Forer declared the presence of this effect where people tend to accept positive sweeping generic statements about themselves as though those statements are solely made for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also called as the Barnum effect. named after P. T. Barum who declared that ‘a sucker is born every minute’ — meaning people are gullible and want to believe what they are told, so they think that general statements are solely about themselves. This effect is also less commonly called the ‘Barnum-Forer effect.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me explain how this translates into our everyday life, the products we use, and the things we do on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, some personal story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;shaadi-kab-hai&#34;&gt;Shaadi kab hai?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is that time in my life (or am I way past that time!) when everybody around me keeps asking, ‘when’s your marriage?’ And being such a bore that I am, I do not have a girlfriend and to add to that, there is a pandemic going on with lockdown imposed everywhere and palpable distress all around. I have had my share of difficulties in finding the ONE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the new age of online dating and online matrimony. The online dating and matrimony Apps would come to my rescue, or so I thought! Where do I start? Ummm… This subject is so delicate that it is super easy to get scammed. I mean it. Of all the myriad features these Apps have, around filters, pricing, preferences, interests etc, I would like to talk about the king of all — the ‘Matches for you’ feature. The ‘matches for you’ feature is supposed to recommend the most suitable ‘match’ for you. It is, however, irritating that they do not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, neither were those matches relevant nor do they make any sense! When I started, the suggestions were super random, highly irrelevant. I was hoping they would get better with my profile, all my details, and my usage. It was only over time that I got convinced that they were not going to get any better!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They use a simple make-believe tactic… that the suggestions are actually tailored for me by presenting them that way. In reality, they are not tailored! The recommendations are made universally applicable to all those who even sparsely have some of my traits. I too believed that those recommendations were really for me for a few days until I realised they were not. And now, I don’t bother much, you see. Reality has dawned upon me and I am still waiting for that miracle to happen… Where Arjuna finally meets his Subhadra. Ahem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, now, whenever I see, ‘Recommended for you’ (not just in the matrimony Apps but also in all the other Apps I use: YouTube, Swiggy, Cure.fit, Netflix etc) — I immediately question whether if they are actually relevant for me or if they are simply imposed upon me. Rather than taking the suggestions for granted, I try to take a moment to pause think through and proceed. This pausing and taking a moment takes effort, a lot of effort. Multiply this with the number of times we come across these situations… it’s unimaginable! We need to consciously train our mind to do so, which we don’t!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, companies impose something on us because it might bring more value to them that way; doing it that way might be in their self-interest and not yours always. Being a Product Manager myself, I subscribe to the fact that users interests should always be at the forefront. Unfortunately, that is not how things are run always. Ethical product building should take precedence over profit-making, morally. Unfortunately, that’s not the reality. Simply put, you are the buyer — you must be beware!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at another more familiar and relatable example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-case-of-horoscopes-and-jyothishis-astrologers&#34;&gt;The case of horoscopes and jyothishis (astrologers)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My brother gets super excited when he reads the daily horoscope predictions in The Times of India newspaper. I can bet that his excitement wouldn’t subside even by a bit if the TOI swapped the ‘Aries’ prediction with the ‘Saggitarius’ one. The statements which are written are so generic that a street hawker would find the same relevance to them as the CEO sitting in a high-end corporate office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same is the case with most of the jyothishis! Don’t believe me? Let me tell you another of my personal stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during my Engineering days, in the year 2007. I had done extremely well in the AIEEE that year. The word was out and some of my relatives did see me as if I was some alien and I was basking in all the glory, I mean, why not! I had gone to my cousin’s place during those holidays to cherish even more. We were watching TV when a jyothishi came to visit us. I didn’t realise what was happening. After the elders exchanged some words, the jyothishi smiled at me and briskly walked towards me. Took my palm into his, and said things (which make me laugh even today) like, ‘very bright future, very good boy. Nice. Will go abroad soon. The family will become proud. Keep it up, beta’. It’s been 14 years and I am still waiting for Hyderabad to be declared as a new country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jyothishi’s statements were so vague and generic that it was ironic how such clear, simple, and direct statements did not make any sense at all! The saddest part, however, was that my sister and mom bought into them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not trying to generalise all the astrologers here. Maybe some predict well, maybe some don’t. I am just stating how gullible we people are to statements even though they are very generic and universally applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;more-examples&#34;&gt;More examples&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another online product where the Forer effect is used brilliantly which created quite some craze among the users is the ‘Know your personality’ game on the Facebook feed. I have seen people share things like ‘You are loyal’, ‘You are good at heart’, ‘You make others smile’, ‘You are like a tiger, ferocious yet caring for your family’ on their feed and as WhatsApp statuses! In fact, I have had conversations with some of them and was surprised by their conviction about their personality based on the results from these games, in spite of these statements being ridiculously generic!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is not when some positive reinforcement happens. Positive reinforcement is good, though ethically questionable and factually incorrect. The problem arises when people attribute themselves to a false sense of reality or when some negative reinforcement happens. And we being humans, succumb to such instances as we do not want to trouble ourselves. When someone starts to believe in something because someone said so without pondering over the correctness of it or putting in an effort to validate if such a thing is true or not is when the trouble begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are many other situations where this happens:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tried the weighing machine at the bus station or the railway station? The weight card has a ‘personal message’ for you! (no it doesn’t)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Received a personal email from the CEO of a company? Hmmm… Looks like the CEO really cares for you! (not really)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A salesperson told you he took a high-level approval to give you the discount? Maybe you should buy the product right away! (please, don’t)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being born in April do you get excited by reading, ‘Legends are born in April’? You probably are a legend, you should get that tattooed! (oh, no! don’t do it)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A news article says that Indians are good at math. You get 30 out of 100 in the class test and yet you feel proud. I guess you should! (no, please!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Received a ‘only for you’ 40% discount notification on Heytm? Maybe they love you more than every other user! (they don’t!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that companies these days use data to create personalization. However, it is extremely difficult to tailor things for you and most of the online products (Netflix, Spotify, Swiggy, Twitter and the like) still have a lot of catching up to do. And till that catching up is done, these companies will present generalization in the disguise of personalization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, whenever someone says that something is exclusively recommended for you, remember that it most probably is not! And whenever you come across generic statements about yourself, just smile and move along, you are better than those generic statements… only you need to question and find out yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you for reading! 🙏🏼&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;😀 Please note that this is the fifth in a series of articles I am writing on Cognitive Biases. If you haven’t read the other four yet, I’d recommend you read them first. &lt;strong&gt;Links below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/confirmation-bias&#34; &gt;Confirmation Bias&lt;/a&gt; ✅&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let’s get started with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dwapar-yug-dronacharya-and-the-elephant&#34;&gt;Dwapar Yug, Dronacharya and the elephant&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahabharata, the epic tale between the two groups of cousins, the Kauravas and the Pandavas, is a tale of a multitude of human desires, emotions and grit and vengeance. Many of its learnings are used in management, leadership and growth. Let’s start with one such small chronicle from this hell of a tale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without going into details, let me try and drive the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the time of the Kurukshetra War. After the death of Bheeshmacharya, Dronacharya becomes the commander-in-chief of the Kaurava army. Krishna knew that Dronacharya was formidable and with him in charge, it was impossible to defeat the Kauravas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to remove Dronacharya was to convince him that his son, Ashwathama, was dead. With his son gone, Dronacharya would give up and he could only then be killed. Krishna, the greatest trickster, devises a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashwathama, who was considered one of the greatest warriors, was not easy to kill. Hence the trick!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per Krishna’s plan, Bheema kills an elephant named Ashwathama after which Yudhisthir declares, ‘Ashwathama hatha (loudly), iti narova kunjarova (whispers)’. Dronacharya who heard this was able to gather only the first half of the sentence, and with Yudhisthir, who was the epitome of Dharma (righteousness), declaring such an event, Dronacharya believed it to be true and gave up himself in the war field, and was then taken down!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, for me, is a classic case of the framing effect. Dronacharya placed enormous trust in Yudhisthir and believed that Yudhisthir would never make a false statement and when Yudhisthir called out that Ashwathama was dead, he instantaneously believed it. In fact, Yudhisthir did not make any false statement either, did he? It was just presented in a way that seemed so. It was cleverly designed (by Krishna) to ensure that it was interpreted in the way it was intended to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is how &lt;strong&gt;the framing effect&lt;/strong&gt; works. It is not the information, but the way it is presented that does the trick. The trick here is to ‘frame’ someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds too pre-historic, eh? Worry not, from the &lt;em&gt;Dwapar Yug&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Kali Yug&lt;/em&gt;, the framing effect shines bright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;kali-yug-and-the-age-of-misinformation&#34;&gt;Kali Yug and the age of (mis)information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at some statements below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India has vaccinated only 3.1% of its population, a meagre number compared to the 41% vaccination rate in the US&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The number of vaccine doses given in India stands at 20.7Cr, a whopping 61% of the US population!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or read how some similar yet strikingly different headlines would create extreme views in a readers mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A staggering 20% of the Indian population is still reeling under the below poverty line (BPL)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive signs for India as the population under BPL has seen a gradual decline from 40% in 2004 to 20% in 2015&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India continues its slump at the Olympics. Wins only 1 bronze&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;India creates history. Karnam Malleswari becomes the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Out of 4, India is the worst team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indian team is the 4th best team in the world!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting examples, but sound too far-fetched. How do they relate to me, hmmm?&lt;br&gt;
Hold on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you go well with memes?&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seems familiar? Been in that situation? I’d bet you did!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-classic-tale-of-discount-marketing&#34;&gt;The classic tale of discount marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are drawn to the discount ‘%’ more than the price itself. The discount % is perceived as saving, as a benefit. And the mind is tricked into believing that you are actually in for a good deal. &lt;strong&gt;A 50% off deal cannot be bad, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trick is used in a myriad number of ways. Let’s see.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-framing-effect/shoe-store.jpeg&#34;
	width=&#34;400&#34;
	height=&#34;300&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-framing-effect/shoe-store_huf4a072f37926aa75d784996d03e14611_16431_480x0_resize_q75_box.jpeg 480w, https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-framing-effect/shoe-store_huf4a072f37926aa75d784996d03e14611_16431_1024x0_resize_q75_box.jpeg 1024w&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;133&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;320px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shoe store displays 40% off. You get lured, you enter the store and try different shoes. However, you notice that the 40% off is only on a few shoes displayed at the corner, as part of the clearance sale, not on all the shoes. But having entered the store already you are reluctant to leave now. And inside the store, the sales agents are ready to entice you more, serve you more and make you feel like their hero. And you try more shoes. The chances are you end up buying a different shoe than what you anticipated when you entered. Happened with you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another example.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-framing-effect/fat-free-ice-cream.jpeg&#34;
	width=&#34;400&#34;
	height=&#34;300&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;133&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;320px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two ice-cream boxes containing the same ingredients display their contents differently. The first box says ‘10% fat’, the second box says ‘90% fat-free!’. It is highly likely that, given a chance, you would choose the second box more often than the first one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other variants of the discount displays include ‘up to 60% off’, ’50% off, offer ends tonight’, ’20% cashback’, ’60% off up to ₹50’ (this is the most ridiculous of all). They all make you feel bad for NOT using them; you may not realise that, but they do! And you want to avoid this ‘bad’ feeling and allow ourselves to be ‘framed’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;framing-effect&#34;&gt;Framing Effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often draw different conclusions from the same information depending on how it is presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framing effect perhaps is one of the most common tricks used by marketers, politicians, news agencies, influencers and not to forget — magicians. As the name itself says, it ‘frames’ the audience into believing what they see (or hear as it was in Dronacharya’s case), depending on how the information is presented. And based on the way information is presented, we draw different conclusions from it — to support a party or not, to buy a shoe or not, to trust a person or not — we do it almost all the time. You could draw a completely wrong conclusion and only realise it much later or not realise it at all! You could have drawn an entirely different conclusion had the information been presented in any different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;politicians-and-the-art-of-framing&#34;&gt;Politicians and the art of framing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more examples 😀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government will glorify the fact that it was able to pave way for a cashless economy due to demonetization but will hide the fact that the currency in circulation, according to the RBI data, was ₹24.2 lakh crore in 2020 compared to ₹16.4 lakh crore in 2016. And also cover it under the rugs that as per the RBI data, about 99% of the invalidated money was returned to the banks. Remember flushing out black money was a prime objective of demonetization? But the government will never bring them to light themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government will call for caution, solidarity and brotherhood among fellow people during these tough Covid times, but will underplay misgovernance and systemic failure at the topmost level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can go on and on with various examples about how clever our people are in framing things and playing it so subtly that you don’t even realise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-am-i-trying-to-say-anyway&#34;&gt;What am I trying to say, anyway?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, coming to the point. The information you consume, from the people you know, from advertisements, from strangers on social media, from newspapers or any other media — they all bear a very high power to influence us. It can sway us away from one view to another extreme view, merely by the way information is presented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People tend to present information that suits their narrative, in a way that doesn’t harm them but helps them. It is natural. It stems from the need for self-protection and preservation. People don’t give away their shortcomings as easily as they glorify their virtues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the onus of identifying the shortcomings (or all the facts) is on the other person. This is prevalent in almost everything you do — purchasing a car, downloading an App, ordering food, looking for a match on matrimony, voting in an election, selecting an insurance plan — the list is endless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, ‘Caveat Emptor’, a Latin phrase, which can be loosely translated into English as ‘let the buyers beware’ is a law in commercial transactions. It places the onus on the buyer to perform due diligence before making a purchase and doesn’t necessarily hold the seller responsible for not disclosing everything — for a simple reason that it is impossible to state ‘everything’ about a product/service. For example, if you want to buy a car from me, I may NOT be able to give the entire history of the car, if it had any accident, how many times was the car taken for servicing, if the windshield is in perfect condition etc. It is your responsibility to check everything that you need to know before you make the payment. By law, the onus is on you while making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this rule, if not law, can be extended beyond commercial transactions. While consuming information, the onus is on the receiver to get the complete information. There always will be grey areas in the information presented and you need to be careful while you draw conclusions from the information presented as it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens all the time — from making new friends to planning a trip, from finding a partner to buying a new house, from choosing a college to starting a company. It is better to take a step back and look at the information from an objective eye by asking more questions and asking for more information. This is difficult and cannot be done all the time. But if not paid enough attention, this could take you for a ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;😀 Please note that this is the fourth in a series of articles I am writing on Cognitive Biases. If you haven’t read the other three yet, I’d recommend you read them first. &lt;strong&gt;Links below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/confirmation-bias&#34; &gt;Confirmation Bias&lt;/a&gt; ✅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/fundamental-attribution-error&#34; &gt;Fundamental Attribution Error&lt;/a&gt; ✅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/ikea-effect&#34; &gt;Ikea effect&lt;/a&gt; ✅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-geyser-story&#34;&gt;The geyser story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, we moved into our newly built house in Hyderabad. Nothing fancy, just a decent one with a few more comforts compared to the old house. For one, the new house had a facility for geyser whereas the old one didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my school friends, Naresh, visited us when we were getting the geysers fitted. We had ordered Havells geysers from Amazon. They seemed fine, the power rating, the warranty, the make of the product and the price — they fit our requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What amazed me was what happened after that. When Naresh wanted to buy geysers for his home, he too ordered the ‘Havells geysers from Amazon’. They performed well and were energy efficient, after all, and it made sense to order the same product he thought. All he did was, he searched for Havells geysers on Amazon, placed the order and they got delivered. Only, there was one problem — &lt;strong&gt;the geyser did not fit the height in his bathroom!&lt;/strong&gt; He did not check that, the geyser did not fit his requirements. And he had to replace it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what happened here? Naresh was presented with a similar situation as I. He just reproduced what I did as if it was the natural thing to do. In fact, it sounds fairly simple too — When I wanted to have a geyser, I ordered a Havells from Amazon and when Naresh wanted to have a geyser, he too ordered a Havells from Amazon, because it worked for me. He took my geyser as an example and applied it in his judgement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realised, when we are in a situation where we are supposed to decide if something works or not, we most often think of the situations in the past and identify what had worked already and reproduce the same. Seems like a fully scientific approach, right? We are using historic data to predict what needs to be done in the future. However, there is one catch. A big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, we, humans, are not computers. Our ability to recollect data and information and process it is limited. We do not see the entire context as clearly. Our natural tendency is to process only that information that is very vivid in our mind. And whatever is vivid doesn’t necessarily mean that it is sufficient and that could lead to some potential errors. So, it requires quite an additional effort to actually process the information in its entirety to avoid errors. But, as you know, our brain is lazy to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking in statistical terms, the sample size or the number of data points we could recollect and process at a time is very minimal. Though the capacity of our brain is unbelievably large, it is just not a natural thing for us to process such larger portions in a very short span of time. Because our life demands us to make decisions all the time, we tend to use the references which are very fresh in our memory to arrive at decisions rather quickly. And if we make the decisions based on the ‘notions’ derived from such a small sample (of memories), we are prone to what is called a &lt;strong&gt;Type II&lt;/strong&gt; error in statistics. It means that due to the small sample size, we conclude that our hypothesis is true, when, in fact, the hypothesis is not true. That means, if we are given a larger number of samples (memories), we would have arrived at a different conclusion, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the behavioural sciences world, the phenomenon of arriving at conclusions based on the examples we can immediately recollect is called the &lt;strong&gt;‘Availability Heuristic.’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;availability-heuristic&#34;&gt;Availability Heuristic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We rely on immediate examples that come to our mind while making judgements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-shawshank-redemption&#34;&gt;The Shawshank Redemption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime back, a group of our friends went for a drive outside of the city. There were a bunch of people whom I met for the first time and made some new friends too. As I was discussing with a girl, she asked me to suggest some good movies to watch. Without any further questions or thoughts, I started to blurt out my favourite movie names, movies which I felt were good — the typical must-watch list — which included The Shawshank Redemption, Shutter Island, The Schindler’s List, The Godfather, some of Nolan’s, and some newly released movies on Netflix and Prime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did I try to actually find out what her interests were or what she liked to watch before suggesting anything! And as it turned out, she watched The Shawshank Redemption and did not find it as compelling as I thought it would! I couldn’t understand why would someone not like such a beautiful movie!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I did there — which, I think, most of you also do — was resorting to a list of movies which I had in my mind, ready as examples to be given to anyone who wanted to watch a movie. The examples were ready, they only needed an avenue to come out and these movies had to be good for everybody, I thought. I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wondering why I am making such a fuss about just watching a movie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me, I am trying to arrive at something here, will you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;some-other-examples&#34;&gt;Some other examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are chilling out with your friends. After a week full of busy office work, you finally get to relax! If a discussion comes up whether it is the government’s failure to control Covid or if it was people’s negligence — which side would you take and whom do you blame? I am sure you won’t do a root cause analysis to arrive at this conclusion. Some would probably quote a few instances where the government was absolutely foolish and some would say that the public behaved irresponsibly and brought it on to themselves. Or some argue for both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, all these discussions are drawn from the examples you and your friends can recollect. But, how good are those examples to actually validate the blame? They are too subjective to even compare and say that one stands way over the above, but our mind forms some heuristics to do this comparison. It somehow can reduce this hugely complex problem to a set of a few examples, and you don’t realise that. You don’t realise that your notions and conclusions can be grossly inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When posed with a situation of ‘why is India not doing well?’, you tend to recollect examples of superficial things, like the population, literacy, pollution, unemployment among others which are very clear in your memory, of which you have an example or two to present as an argument to validate your views. But you don’t realise that these are not sufficient to establish your argument. These are only the things that are available to your memory, to state as examples. They are not sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-examples&#34;&gt;More examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are not promoting a deserving candidate— ‘When I had an interaction with her last time, she seemed very immature.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which restaurant to go to for dinner? — ‘Where did we go last time?’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What food to order? — ‘What did we order last time, either order the same thing or order anything other than that?’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Want to buy a new hair straightener? — ‘Which brand’s Ad did I see recently?’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling lazy to choose what to wear to the office? — ‘Which dress gave me good compliments from a bunch of people?’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is he a good guy? — ‘What did my friend tell me about him?’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this investment worth it? — ‘Did it work for others I know?’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-whats-the-problem-with-this-anyway&#34;&gt;So, what’s the problem with this, anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t you curse Netflix if it only shows you video recommendations based on just the recent browsing history and not considering all your older watch history? Wouldn’t that be irritating? Wouldn’t you be annoyed at how lame the recommendations are? What you like to watch cannot just be based on one day’s activity, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, just like how Netflix’s recommendation system works, you too should not judge anything or anyone based on one or two examples that come to your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s look at a few more examples that can take a hit on your pocket straight away.&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe, then you’d realise the importance ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the August of 2020. If you follow the world of commodities, you would know that the gold prices hit an all-time high! Many of my friends had bought gold; gold seemed to be a good investment, after all. However, one friend, unfortunately, saw this trend. He badly wanted to invest his money and even asked me for better ways of investment — I couldn’t help as I am no good — So, when he saw that others already made good profits from gold, he wanted to do just that! He bought ₹2,00,000 worth of gold at a whopping ₹5,600/gram! That’s it… Bam! As you must be guessing, the prices fell from there… He lost ₹20,000 in one day and is still hoping the price to climb up. But hey, the current price is nowhere near that point!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait! This happened pretty recently too… &lt;strong&gt;Does Doge strike a chord?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because you have vivid examples of others who made profits from a particular investment, you cannot judge that it is going to be good for you too, right? By looking at an example just as an example without the constraints and the context it is operating in, you cannot make a correct judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say, information is wealth, but ensure that you have the complete information, not just a few examples to suit your narration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hmm. Gotcha.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-do-we-have-this-bias-anyway&#34;&gt;Why do we have this bias, anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All cognitive biases are based on the fact that our brain is lazy and doesn’t want to do any work unless necessary. That it wants to waste as few resources as possible and consume lesser and lesser energy. And use it only when needed, in the best possible way. However, for the brain to take the best possible way and use the resources in an efficient way we have to train it! But we don’t do that very often, do we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever there is a need to process information, the mind looks for the easiest possible way to do it. Of the many ways and shortcuts which the mind takes — I discussed a few of these in my previous articles &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/confirmation-bias&#34; &gt;Confirmation Bias&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/ikea-effect&#34; &gt;IKEA effect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; — finding a similar example for comparison is probably more qualified yet an easier option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you judge someone or something, you automatically scan for a benchmark — a benchmark in that category or in that field or in that country or in that region or the community or in that era. Anything that could be used to form some notion about whether this someone or something is good in comparison with the immediate examples that occur to you, that you could recollect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that’s not how judgements are supposed to be made — read my article on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/fundamental-attribution-error&#34; &gt;Fundamental Attribution Error&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; where I talk about how judgements should usually be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-how-to-avoid-falling-into-these-pitfalls&#34;&gt;So, how to avoid falling into these pitfalls?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try and avoid getting into ‘urgent’ situations.&lt;/strong&gt; Give your mind enough time and resources to take a calculated decision. This could be done by avoiding getting into ‘urgent’ situations as much as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do research.&lt;/strong&gt; When you know that you just have one example which you are using to conclude, look out for more examples. Look out for more data points. Look out for more evidence. Do not decide straight off the bat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discuss and deliberate.&lt;/strong&gt; Many times we do not know whether it came from one example or multiple data points. We do not know whether our choice is the best one or not. It is safe to discuss and deliberate on your choices with others whom you trust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;😀 Please note that this is the third in a series of articles I am writing on Cognitive Biases. If you haven’t read the other two yet, I’d recommend you read them first. &lt;strong&gt;Links below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/confirmation-bias&#34; &gt;Confirmation Bias&lt;/a&gt; ✅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/fundamental-attribution-error&#34; &gt;Fundamental Attribution Error&lt;/a&gt; ✅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let’s get started with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-whatsdplan&#34;&gt;🚀 WhatsDplan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rameshkatreddi/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Ramesh Kumar Katreddi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and I started &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/company/whatsdplan&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;WhatsDplan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. We had deliberated quite a lot on the product we wanted to build and out of the numerous ideas we had, we narrowed it down to one and started building it. We had quit our jobs and laboured day and night to build the best product we could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were building an event planning application for friends. We loved the idea from the beginning and we thought that the product we were building would be loved by everyone around, used by many and would be an instant hit. As naive as it may sound, I did think that WhatsDplan was a breakthrough product! I mean why would anyone not like such a beautiful product, right!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, I was wrong. People did not use it as much as I thought they would. In fact, people did not use it at all! There were hardly any repeat users and the number of users dipped day by day. I was gutted and there was nothing I could do about it. My heart sank and I felt devastated. I still hoped that something miraculous would happen for people to realise its value. And, of course, nothing miraculous happened!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started working on the App idea because we loved it and put our heart, blood and sweat into developing it. If you ask any startup founder you will get the same answer. But, does that mean that others also would value our product as much as we do? Most of the time, the answer is no. It was only much later that I realised that our App did not provide much value to the users and they did not like it as much as we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realised that for the things I create, people do not assign the same amount of value as I do. In fact, I realised I assign a disproportionately high amount of value to the things that I create, but others don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just me, you too are the greatest lover of your work, aren’t you? You too would have a thing or two in your closet that you value a lot, right? A childhood sketch maybe? Or a painting or a hand-written note or the prizes you’d won! Don’t you value them so much? You don’t realise, but you probably value them very highly! More so, if you are an artist, you are likely to value your video or a song or a film or a poem or even a piece of quote/tagline more highly than your friends’ who do similar work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why do we attach so much value to things we create? There’s a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-the-ikea-effect&#34;&gt;🎇 The IKEA effect&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IKEA effect simply says that we place a higher value on things we partially created ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the many Cognitive Biases, the IKEA effect draws its name from the world-famous Swedish furniture company, IKEA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At IKEA, you don’t always get a fully assembled product. In many cases, you get parts of the furniture in boxes and you assemble them yourself. And as it happens, because you are assembling your furniture, you assign more value to it and hence are more likely to go back to IKEA again than any other furniture store. Pretty smart, eh!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word ‘IKEA effect’ was first coined by Michael Nortan, Daniel Mochon and Dan Ariely in their 2012 paper titled ‘IKEA effect: When labour leads to love.’ The paper opens with a famous ‘instant cake mixes’ story from the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, when the instant cake mixes were introduced into the market, they did not perform well. The sales did not pick up. When the manufacturers studied the reasons for why such a good product was not picking up, they found that the instant cake mixes took away the need to ‘put in the effort’ to make cakes at home. They made the housewives think that it made cooking too easy and they did not value them as much. By removing the need for effort and labour, the cake mixes de-valued themselves instead of improving the value. So, later, when the manufacturers re-launched them by introducing an extra step where the housewives had to add an egg into the mix before baking, they gained popularity and it was a hit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, as humans, have the psychological need to feel competent, that we are capable of doing something and can learn and overcome obstacles. We don’t like to be seen as incompetent or foolish. This could be linked to the time when a man’s survival depended on his competence and his ability — to hunt and to safeguard himself and his family. Not just for survival, but also for his status, his power and improving his chances of mating — they all demanded his competency. This is true even to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason why the IKEA effect happens is ‘Effort Justification’. When we work hard for something, we tend to believe that all our effort was for a good reason, that there was a purpose which we were working towards. And no matter what the outcome, we place more value on it because we worked hard for a good reason in the first place. We think we are rational and want to justify that all that time and effort are not mere wastes! So, we convince ourselves that our ‘thing’ is more valuable than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we create something, we not only feel good at the moment, but it also fulfils a deep psychological need. We derive happiness and the feeling of happiness gets etched in our memory. And when we create something, we find it to be more valuable than it is because of this extra dose of happiness it gives us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-some-examples&#34;&gt;📑 Some examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it, which one would you value more: a greeting card with a long personal note you wrote yourself or a greeting card that has a well-written thank you note by a professional? You likely value the card with your personal message more than the other although the message on the professional card is better in every way — in terms of content, emotions, grammar and presentation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example, if you haven’t already, bake a cake! I bet you’d value it more than the most delicious cake from the best bakery in the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just in personal lives, it happens at our workplace too. You spend a lot of time in research, deliberate a lot and propose an idea to a problem. You instantly fall in love with the idea — no matter how bad or impractical it is. You think that it is great and is worth giving a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you work hard and execute a project to completion. You think that it is worthy of the ‘best project’ award. However, it baffles you when your manager doesn’t give you any recognition!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-is-that-wrong&#34;&gt;🤔 Is that wrong?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might say, of course, you value things more because of your emotional attachment with them because you created them and only you know how hard you worked for it. And this is good. Valuing things is good. Because you value things, you take care of them, you ensure their longevity and nurture them if required. This leads to a more caring, loving and sustainable world — a better place to live, after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if your biased decision-making affects others’ lives then there is a problem. This cannot be ignored. That would not make the world just. As a society, we need to consider others’ interests as well to make it a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;more-examples&#34;&gt;📑More examples&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider an example, a politician is adamant about not revoking a policy just because he spent many months creating it although the policy is irrelevant in the present day and is affecting millions of people.
Or your manager who doesn’t change an existing process because she had spent innumerable hours devising the process a couple of years ago and works just fine even today, or so she thinks! However, it is you and your team who are facing the brunt of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or you work the whole night analysing the market and arrive at some conclusive finding to improve your company revenue. However, in the morning you find some evidence which renders your findings inconclusive. Yet, you go ahead and discuss the actionable based on your analysis from the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or as a manager, when you have an option to choose between your work and your subordinate’s, you disregard the work by your subordinate even though you know deep down that her work is better than yours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds unfair, right? It is! And we all are party to it, thanks to our lazy and self-obsessed mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-so-how-to-avoid-this&#34;&gt;💎 So, how to avoid this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could think of a few ways, you can add more in the comments!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🩺 Take a second opinion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you are deeply engrossed in your creation you do not realise its disadvantages. You tend to think that all is good and get blindsided. So, it is always good to take a second opinion, run it with others and be open for feedback. In most cases, you are not an expert in the area you are working on, so it is always better to be open to expert opinions and other ideas as well.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For example&lt;/strong&gt;, if you made a new Sales deck, run it by your colleagues and ask for feedback. Don’t assume that it is the best deck on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;❤️ Think from a third-person’s point of view&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Thinking from someone else’s point of view is not easy. It needs a lot of empathy and empathy is not developed overnight. But, with experience and by talking to more and more people you will have it. And once you have it, it is only a question of whether or not you are willing to make that extra effort to put yourself in the other person’s shoe.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For example&lt;/strong&gt;, if you prepared a plan for your kids for the summer vacation, try and get a grasp of what they think of it. Do they like it too?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🧐 Read the environment&lt;/strong&gt;
And when people do not directly give you the feedback or share how they feel, you need to go out of your way to see how they are responding. Watch out for signs yourself. Do they really like it too or is it just your belief? Is your work affecting them in any adverse way? Is there anything you could do to make things better?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;For example&lt;/strong&gt;, if you launched a new leave policy at the workplace, listen to the chatter around. Listen to what the employees are saying about it. Are there any changes you should do to the policy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;⛔ Be ready to accept failure&lt;/strong&gt;
All your efforts won’t be fruitful. All your creations won’t be great. You must accept that. Most of your works fail. And from failures, you learn. Only when you accept the fact that your work is not great is when you strive to create something remarkable. And when you strive for something truly remarkable — you usually end up doing that!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Eg.:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, no examples for this one! 😜&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you for reading! 🙏🏼&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/congnitive-bias-fundamental-attribution-error/fundamental-attribution-error.png" alt="Featured image of post Cognitive Biases - Part 02: Fundamental Attribution Error" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;👋🏼 Hello! Thank you for stopping by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note that this is the second in a series of articles I am writing on Cognitive Biases. If you haven’t read the first article yet, I’d recommend you read that first 😀. &lt;strong&gt;Link below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/confirmation-bias&#34; &gt;Confirmation Bias&lt;/a&gt; ✅&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fundamental-attribution-error&#34;&gt;Fundamental Attribution Error&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fundamental Attribution Error basically says that we judge others based on their personality and fundamental character, but judge ourselves based on our situation and circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain this, I am going to take a rather filmy route. Please bear with me as I get into quite a few details of these film stories to drive home the point. If you are into movies, you’d enjoy it, I believe. Even otherwise, cut me some slack, would you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;section-375&#34;&gt;Section 375&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at the story of the movie Section 375. If you have watched it already, you’d be able to relate better, but for others, I’ve tried to lay the plot briefly below to give you enough context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie is a very well written courtroom drama with Tarun Saluja (Akshaye Khanna) as the defence lawyer, Hiral Gandhi (Richa Chadda) as the prosecutor arguing rape charges filed by the victim Anjali Dangle (Meera Chopra) against Rohan Khurana (Rahul Bhatt).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rohan, a successful Bollywood director and Anjali, a budding costume designer hoping to build a successful career in the industry, get along well in showbiz. Anjali bags a couple of big projects working under Rohan and is optimistic of a bright future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their relationship, however, turns into an affair and when things do not turn out well between the two is when the plot thickens. And it is unfortunate and absolutely miserable to see people in influential position misuse their power to personal whims and fancies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, one thing leads to another and Rohan (who is already married to Kainaaz Khurana) ends the affair suddenly and withdraws Anjali from all the ongoing projects. From working on a few big projects and making a name for herself in the industry to losing everything instantly, reality hits Anjali hard. She realises this, apologises to Rohan and goes back to him to avoid any further lost opportunities. Taking advantage of his position, Rohan calls her to his residence and yet again, tries to exploit her of the situation, assaults her and forces her into having sex. Anjali couldn’t stand it any further, it was the end of the line for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as it happens, Anjali files a case against Rohan for rape and sexual assault. She presses charges and gains the media and public support overnight!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the case is discussed in a highly engaging courtroom drama. One thing I particularly like about this movie is how fine the dialogues are written and how the director, Ajay Bahl, explores a very controversial and uncomfortable territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this backdrop and before discussing the movie any further, let’s look at a few things very objectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is Rohan a nice guy? Absolutely not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did Rohan have a history of misbehaviour? Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did Anjali have an affair with Rohan, knowing he is married? Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did Anjali have consensual sex with Rohan before the rape incident? Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does having a bad past make the accused guilty of current charges? No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do we have strong proof of rape? Not rape, but marks of physical abuse and sex. And a confession by Anjali.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did Anjali have a blemishless history to take her word as gospel? No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, as you can see — the case stands on a knife’s edge. And in cases like these, the victim’s confession against the accused is sufficient to pronounce him guilty. And the court will decide that based on the facts, the evidence and the victim’s statement, which will be the final judgement and that is fine! And that’s exactly how a judgement is passed — after a thorough and unbiased examination of the facts and evidence, not from hearsay and definitely not because some section of the public thinks so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what has this story got to do with Fundamental Attribution Error, you wonder?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I gave this entire backdrop is to show the relevance and importance of context and facts before a judgement is passed about anything or anyone. And the ‘Fundamental Attribution Error’ I would like to refer to in this story is that made by the media and the public, &lt;strong&gt;people like you and me. People like us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the defence lawyer, Tarun, was seen by the media and the public as the villain for defending the accused. In fact, even Hiral Gandhi, the prosecutor (who herself was Tarun’s student) was surprised at Tarun’s lack of awareness. She wondered how Tarun was not able to see things that clearly portrayed Rohan guilty and was surprised at how hard he was trying to defend Rohan of rape charges!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The media and public outrage are understandable — they are disgusted with such pathetic behaviour of men across industries, strata, and geographies. But are they right in calling the accused guilty already? Because people knew Rohan’s past and his character, they judged him based on his past and his character than the facts. And they believed it and could have bet their life on it. They believed they were right, no matter what the actual truth was. They knew that Rohan was a sick person, and hence must be the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, is that the truth? Did their judgement stand on a strong ground? Were they prone to the fundamental attribution error? I guess so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it happens in the end, Anjali confesses to Hiral Gandhi that it was not rape. Anjali couldn’t digest the fact that she got those projects, not because of her talent and skills but because Rohan did her a favour by spending time with him. She felt like a whore, and was hurt. She wanted to take revenge. Cleverly, and with vengeance, she made a case for herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have stretched the explanation by quite a bit on a very sensitive topic, you think. But let me tell you, it is prevalent in many and very mundane real-life situations as well. But before going there, let me tell you another story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chak-de-india&#34;&gt;Chak De! India&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Kabir Khan from Chak De! India?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie opens with the final between India and Pakistan in the World Hockey Championship. Pakistan is leading 2–1. With 2 minutes to go India desperately need a goal. And luckily for India, they get a penalty shot. It is highly unlikely to not score a goal on a penalty shot. So, all the Indians, the team management, the entire team and the captain Kabir Khan — all are very hopeful of the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kabir Khan takes the shot and as the drama unfolds, he misses it! India loses the final!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire country is disappointed at the loss. The public outrage is palpable. The media accuses Kabir Khan of the loss. With a few pictures of Kabir Khan with the Pakistan players, it questions his patriotism. The question catches heat and in no time the public actually declares him as a traitor. A traitor who gave away the win to Pakistan. Kabir Khan’s neighbourhood disowned him. He and his family were forced to vacate and move to a new place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why? How did the public come to that conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do India-Pakistan matches carry an extra dose of emotions? &lt;em&gt;Hell, yes!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did India lose the match against Pakistan? &lt;em&gt;Yes, happens in sports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Was there a possibility that the loss was just circumstantial? Definitely. &lt;em&gt;You can’t control everything that happens in a hockey match!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People were outraged by the loss. &lt;em&gt;Yes, understandable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The loss was attributed to Kabir Khan. &lt;em&gt;Yes, understandable. He was the captain, after all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did Kabir Khan deliberately lose the match? &lt;em&gt;No!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kabir Khan was a Muslim. &lt;em&gt;This shouldn’t matter, but it did for the public.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being a Muslim is attributed as favouritism to Pakistan. &lt;em&gt;I guess this is a stretch, but again the public attributed it whatsoever!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Displaying sportsmanship by shaking hands is attributed as anti-national. &lt;em&gt;The public had taken it too far here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it may seem alright that people were outraged and furious about the loss and this kind of accusation could just have been an outpour of emotions. This, right here, is a Fundamental Attribution Error. When you look at it again, people were strongly carried away by their emotions because of the loss and believed that the loss was only because of Kabir Khan. Unfortunately, in that flurry of emotions, they took it too far, they declared him anti-national on the mere basis that he was a Muslim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All this filmy Gyan is OK! Does this happen in real life too?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We make this kind of attribution errors in our life too! We jump to conclusions and judge others based on our prior notion, opinion and perception about them. If someone does something, we do not critically assess the situation and pass our judgement based on our preconceived notions in the spur of the moment. Though we think we are very rational, we are driven by emotions most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give you some examples. Real-ones this time :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;performance-appraisals&#34;&gt;Performance appraisals!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you feel that you are not being recognised? That your performance rating and salary hike is not as per your expectations despite working really hard and giving all you got because your boss is an idiot? But your colleague is well promoted and treated nicely because she maintains good terms with her manager despite not being very talented and hard-working as you are?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you blame your poor performance on your boss but your colleague’s better rating on her character?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure about you, but I certainly did. In one of my previous companies, I did not get the hike I expected, I blamed my poor performance on the market and my manager for not recognizing my efforts. I, in fact, was convinced that only those who are in the close network of the manager got the benefits, not all! I blamed my inability to perform on my circumstances and my manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few years, I now know that I was wrong! I know that I was naive. That growth requires effort and it can’t just merely be circumstantial. Now I don’t take others’ growth for granted just like mine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, we wear different lens when we judge others and different (self-fulfilling) lens when we judge ourselves.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get reminded of this meme, ‘tumhara kutta tommy, hamara kutta kutta?’ — says how self-serving we are, how we judge others to suit our convenience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We favour our own people and disregard others. If we make some mistake, we blame it on the situation. But if the same mistake is made by others, we somehow know for a fact that it is because of their inability, their personality and their carelessness. We care less about the role of circumstances and situations in the case of others than in our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, we are not ready to cut someone some slack because of their past choices and past mistakes. We carry their past all through our life and use it to judge them. And judge them as per our convenience, to fit our narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds strange? Let’s look at some more examples…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone fails an entrance exam, you say ‘he’s not capable.’ But, if you fail in the exam, the narrative changes to ‘I had a fever, I couldn’t study.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone is good at sketching, ‘he’s just talented.’ And why don’t you sketch? ‘you know I don’t have time to practice.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If a colleague takes a leave because he’s sick, you already know he is lying. But when you fall sick and skip work, nobody should blame you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone loses money in stocks, ‘she’s such a bad investor.’ But if you lose money in stocks, ‘the market crashed!’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone did not get selected for a job, ‘he was not qualified in the first place.’ But if you did not get selected, ‘the interviewer asked tough questions.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone loses a game, ‘she was unfit, she shouldn’t have been selected.’ But if you lose a business deal, ‘they did not understand the benefits of our product.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also pass judgements based on mere appearances and personalities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A candidate is not well organized and well planned because he is wearing a wrinkled shirt in an interview.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A girl is a slut because she is wearing a skirt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A girl is inviting you for sex because she is talking to you with a smile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone is lazy just because he is fat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These judgements might be true in some cases. But they are most certainly NOT true all the time. We form these judgments because our mind is in a rush and our experience says that these are true most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is chaotic and we are trying to figure out our way through all this chaos. It’s like cracking a code or solving a puzzle. It appears very random at first, but as we solve it we see patterns and realise that we can crack the code by following those patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in life too, we are trying to find patterns around us — the way people talk, the way they eat, the way they commute, the way they dress, the way they treat others etc. And when we see a pattern, it gets registered in our mind. We use these patterns subsequently to navigate through the chaos and make choices quickly. That, however, doesn’t mean that the patterns hold good all the time. There could be and there will be deviations in the patterns. And in life, we should embrace these deviations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We must be cognizant of the fact that our judgements could be wrong and think twice before we judge or comment on others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cognitive Biases - Part  01: Confirmation Bias</title>
        <link>https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-confirmation-bias/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 20 Jun 2021 23:10:47 +0530</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-confirmation-bias/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-confirmation-bias/confirmation-bias.png" alt="Featured image of post Cognitive Biases - Part  01: Confirmation Bias" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;cognitive-biases&#34;&gt;Cognitive Biases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive Biases are a set of unwritten guidelines that nudge us to make decisions and take actions. They reduce our mental or intellectual effort to process information and make rational choices. We generally follow them without our awareness and in total submission. We follow them as they reduce our cognitive overload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, very commonly, fall into the trap of these biases as they are easy to follow, reduce the stress and efforts to decide and take an action. Our brain is wired to process information only when necessary. It wants to off-load as much of its work as possible and go into the ‘chill zone’ as soon and as often as possible. It doesn’t want to be disturbed. It wants to be left alone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, we form some heuristics with which we process information without troubling the brain very much and very often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;confirmation-bias&#34;&gt;Confirmation Bias&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One such heuristic, one such bias, is the Confirmation Bias. Let me give you a situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, go through this situation and think about what would you do in such a situation. Don’t lie to yourself — more likely than not, you are biased ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, let’s see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are part of your school WhatsApp group. The group, which was formed 4 years ago, is moderately active. Members generally post birthday or anniversary wishes, news on current affairs, some memes and jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fine day, a discussion starts on Football. You don’t watch much Football and are just aware of only a few famous leagues and players. The discussion picks up heat, and some of your friends are madly debating about who is the best: &lt;strong&gt;Messi or Ronaldo!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You go away for an hour and when you come back, you see &lt;strong&gt;937 unread&lt;/strong&gt; messages. You go berserk. Stunned by this madness, you like to figure out who is the best yourself! And you have the greatest resort one can have to aid you in this endeavour, &lt;strong&gt;the all-knowing master of the universe: Google!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you had to ask Google to find out who is actually ‘The Best’, what would you type? What would you search for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, pause for a moment and think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, really, pause and think. What is the phrase that you’d search in Google?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am serious. Pause and think!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, did you think? Ready now?
Fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before reading further, write the phrase you’d search for in the comments below (or write it down somewhere) so that you have proof and you can lock it down. We will come back to it in a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can continue reading after you comment. Trust me, it will be fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Done commenting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok. Now that you’ve decided what you’d search for, let’s see the possibilities. I have written some possible searches and their results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is messi better than ronaldo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;is ronaldo better than messi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why is messi better than ronaldo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why is ronaldo better than messi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who is better, messi or ronaldo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;who is the best between messi and ronaldo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;football statistics of messi and ronaldo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there could be many other combinations, but let us look at these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Based on the order in which you read those articles, you form some initial opinion about Messi and Ronaldo.&lt;/strong&gt; You start to subscribe to what you read. And as each subsequent fact reinforces the previously read facts, your belief in it strengthens. Once you read a good number of articles (could just be 2 or 3), you will form a very strong opinion about each player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Options 1, 2, 3, 4:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Please go through the below Google results carefully…
&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-confirmation-bias/options1234.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1400&#34;
	height=&#34;1281&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-confirmation-bias/options1234_hu47ef9f3d5c17ddbbf2b6c3a033681907_516293_480x0_resize_box_3.png 480w, https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-confirmation-bias/options1234_hu47ef9f3d5c17ddbbf2b6c3a033681907_516293_1024x0_resize_box_3.png 1024w&#34;

		alt=&#34;is one better than the other&#34;
	
	
		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;109&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;262px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, as you can see, these results are already biased towards one player (Messi) than the other! &lt;strong&gt;Google filters out articles for you that tend to argue that Messi is better than Ronaldo!&lt;/strong&gt; And as you read one article after the other, the reinforcement (the confirmation of your beliefs) happens, you tend to subscribe to one school of thought. So, if you search ‘is messi better than ronaldo’, you are more likely to end up in the ‘Messi Clan’ than the ‘Ronaldo Clan’ as you read more articles that favour Messi over Ronaldo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And once you end up in that clan, you do not question your allegiance at all! Would you? I mean, according to you, you have searched by all fairness and Google is CLEARLY saying that Messi is better than Ronaldo. And you wouldn’t doubt the ‘all-knowing master’, would you? Hence you are right! Or, so you think!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, a while ago, you did not have any connection with Football. You do not watch much of Football and do not have much knowledge about the players and probably have a piece of very poor knowledge about what’s happening in the Football world. Yet, here you are, almost convinced that Messi is better than Ronaldo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar will be the search results for options 2, 3, and 4 — and you tend to form a strong opinion on either Messi or Ronaldo based on those articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Options 5, 6:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Please read these results carefully now…
&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-confirmation-bias/options56.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1400&#34;
	height=&#34;1311&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-confirmation-bias/options56_huf4a70772533d05c02a0c97c238681c6c_545362_480x0_resize_box_3.png 480w, https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-confirmation-bias/options56_huf4a70772533d05c02a0c97c238681c6c_545362_1024x0_resize_box_3.png 1024w&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;106&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;256px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, searches 5 and 6 are not targeted to either Messi or Ronaldo and they give a set of partially unbiased results. Yet, these results are someone’s opinions about both the players. So, if the author of those articles is partially biased towards any player, that would reflect in the article as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 7:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-confirmation-bias/option7.png&#34;
	width=&#34;1400&#34;
	height=&#34;1316&#34;
	srcset=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-confirmation-bias/option7_hu328ee8703b158fd8b20289370e06b912_512340_480x0_resize_box_3.png 480w, https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/cognitive-bias-confirmation-bias/option7_hu328ee8703b158fd8b20289370e06b912_512340_1024x0_resize_box_3.png 1024w&#34;

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;106&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;255px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search results for 7 give statistics about the players. &lt;strong&gt;They give details about the number of matches, goals, awards, possession time, win % etc.&lt;/strong&gt; These will help you do an easy number-by-number comparison. However, comparing different kinds of numbers is also not easy. I mean, it is not possible to compare the number of goals to the ball possession time or the number of assists or the number of awards etc. Also, if you know a little about Football, you will know that the game is not just about numbers, after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-actually-compare-then&#34;&gt;How to actually compare then?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you really wanted to make such a comparison, you’d have to watch 100s of Football matches, read through 100s of player stats and study the hardships each player faced in their life among other things. And the best answer you could probably arrive at is that the comparison itself is futile! Each of them is ‘best’ in their own way… Or if you had to conclude, you’d be very specific and categorical in your answer instead of giving a generic statement like ‘Messi is better than Ronaldo’. &lt;strong&gt;Because the harder question people forget to ask here is what does ‘better’ actually mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, who really wants to go through this gruelling process of analysing the information in such an impartial way just to decide who is a better player, right! Instead, we tend to spend some time going through various videos and articles on the internet and form our own opinion as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it is not just for discussions like these but also for many important decisions in our life that we ignore such thinking. We do not want to burden ourselves so much in our daily decision making. &lt;strong&gt;We off-load as much thinking as possible and spend our mental energy only in certain situations — typically the office work!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This kind of confirmation bias happens all the time:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Religious affiliations: Is Hinduism better than Christianity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Political affiliations: Is Biden better than Trump&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National Affairs: Is the farm bill bad for the farmers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fanbases: Is Marvel better than DC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diet plans: Is Vegan better than Keto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global warming is not real&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Covid vaccines do not work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The list is endless!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we are no experts in certain situations, we rely on the views or opinions of others on the subject and seek answers. However, rather than looking for answers, &lt;strong&gt;we should question what we are looking for!&lt;/strong&gt; Sadly, that kind of questioning requires a lot of rationality and our mind is super lazy to do that! The mind would rather know the answer ready-made than actually probe further. It would take the answer on the face of it than question the correctness of the question itself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Confirmation Bias, basically, reinforces your already existing notions, beliefs, opinions, views, and expectations about anything. This helps us assess a situation faster, make decisions quickly and take necessary actions immediately. With that, we can spend our ‘mental energy’ on things that actually matter to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This happens because our mind doesn’t like to be questioned. It doesn’t want to be challenged. It doesn’t want to lose. It wants to win. It wants to be satisfied. The moment it finds that what it thinks is true, it becomes happy and reinforces that thought and tends to relax without any effort to validate it further. It requires an extra push to take the next step and validate further and we don’t want to give that extra push!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if it finds out anything contrary to the existing beliefs and expectations, it denies, resists, becomes restless and unhappy. And the mind tries very hard to avoid such situations and the easy way to do that is to comply with anything that reinforces the existing beliefs without questioning further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the next time, when you think you are sure of something, that you are not biased in what you are saying and that you make total sense… &lt;strong&gt;Think again!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

        <title>Hooked - book review</title>
        <link>https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/hooked-book-review/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2021 20:40:29 +0530</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/hooked-book-review/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/hooked-book-review/dice.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Hooked - book review" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hooked is one of those books which I would recommend to every aspiring Product Manager. In fact, anyone who is even sparsely connected with human psychology or behaviour should read this. It is a short, quick read and insightful with some clever real-world examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading the book, I had collated some important and wow moments in my notepad. I wanted to share them with others and thus this article. Please note that this in no way is the gist of the book! These are just some cool observations I made while reading the book and there could be plenty other cool observations I would have missed. So, I strongly recommend you to read the book than reading this article (yes, I am trying to sabotage myself here! — anything for a good read, right?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/hooked-book-review/hooked.jpeg&#34;

		data-flex-basis=&#34;568px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that you have decided to read this article, let’s do it…
The title of the book ‘Hooked’ is indicative of the user behaviour while using some of the current digital products. Products like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Spotify, Netflix and plenty others have quite literally hooked their users to use the product again and again. The author, &lt;strong&gt;Nir Eyal&lt;/strong&gt;, explores the reason for this addictive behaviour and simply presents his findings with some cool real-life examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nir Eyal analyses the user behaviour with the help of ‘The Hook Model’ — a habit-forming cycle of Trigger — Action — Variable Reward — Investment. It is this cycle that transforms behaviour into a routine and a habit. It is this cycle that helps us either make or break any habit. (This was described by &lt;strong&gt;James Clear&lt;/strong&gt; in his book ‘Atomic Habits’ as well. Atomic Habits is another fantastic read if you are interested.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/hooked-book-review/the-hook-model.png&#34;
	width=&#34;448&#34;

		data-flex-grow=&#34;86&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;207px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Trigger phase, you are prompted by some trigger— either external or internal. This could be some information or a text message or a notification or a sound or an emotion or a memory from the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;example-a-facebook-notification-sanjay-and-5-others-have-commented-on-your-post&#34;&gt;Example: A Facebook notification: ‘Sanjay and 5 others have commented on your post’&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, in the Action phase, you take an action as a response to that trigger — something as small as replying to someone or as big as purchasing a house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;example-you-like-sanjays-comment&#34;&gt;Example: You like Sanjay’s comment&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third step is about ‘Rewards’. All human actions inherently expect rewards and you take actions in anticipation of rewards. Nir Eyal uses ‘variable rewards’ and not just ‘rewards’ here. This is because you are more likely to form a habit because of the variable component of the reward than the reward itself. I will discuss this in detail later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last step in the Hook Model is Investment and it is critical for building habits. You can think of this as an investment of your resource: time or money or emotion etc. The more you invest your resources into a product, the more you value it and more likely are you to go back to it again. In other words, your perceived value of a product increases as you spend more time on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think about it, all these ‘addictive’ products try to keep you glued to them for as long as possible! And you tend to go back to using the product again with the slightest of a trigger because you have already invested much of your time or money or emotion into it, you want to see how that investment has shaped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;example-as-you-liked-sanjays-comment-you-are-drawn-to-another-post-by-a-mutual-friend-of-yours-and-sanjays-you-click-that-and-bang--you-enter-the-world-of-infinite-scroll-and-auto-play-videos-and-before-you-notice-you-have-already-spent-the-last-25min-watching-an-uncle-dance-some-babies-giggle-and-cats-do-funny-faces&#34;&gt;Example: As you liked Sanjay’s comment, you are drawn to another post by a mutual friend of yours and Sanjay’s. You click that, and bang — you enter the world of infinite scroll and auto-play videos. And before you notice, you have already spent the last 25min watching an uncle dance, some babies giggle and cats do funny faces.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But why is this happening?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lets-look-deeper-into-the-hook-model&#34;&gt;Let’s look deeper into the Hook Model:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;triggers&#34;&gt;Triggers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two kinds of triggers for taking any action: &lt;strong&gt;external and internal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External Triggers:&lt;/strong&gt;
External Triggers are those which are caused by an external stimulus, by some outside force or outside substance. Businesses use different types of external triggers prompting a user to take action :\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paid trigger.&lt;/strong&gt; Example: Spotify’s advertises for its new video podcasts. This makes you curious to check that out because you know that Spotify is a music streaming application and this advertisement about video podcasts surprises you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earned trigger.&lt;/strong&gt; A typical PR or a media mention. Example: Elon Musk’s tweet about Signal: ‘Use Signal’ caused mass hysteria and many started to use Signal after that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationship trigger.&lt;/strong&gt; Example: Your friend tells you about how cool the new ‘FaceApp’ is and you feel like trying it once
Owned trigger. A typical subscription, like that of a newsletter or a club membership, or an App icon on the phone. Example: You subscribed to Medium and open it once a week as Medium sends you an email about a new viral article every week. Or you frequently open WhatsApp on your phone just because the App icon is visible to you on your home screen. Owned triggers increase the repeat engagement of the user. Without owned triggers, it is difficult to form a habit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal Triggers:&lt;/strong&gt;
Human emotions are the internal triggers that prompt the user to take an action. More often than not, negative emotions drive the user to spontaneously take an action than positive emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative Emotions:&lt;/strong&gt; boredom, fear, loneliness, frustration, confusion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive Emotions:&lt;/strong&gt; happiness, motivation, compassion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;example-now-and-then-when-you-feel-like-you-are-bored-you-tend-to-open-facebook-or-youtube-just-to-check-whats-going-on-without-any-external-trigger&#34;&gt;Example: Now and then when you feel like you are bored, you tend to open Facebook or Youtube just to check what’s going on, without any external trigger.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New habits are sparked by external triggers, but the associations with internal triggers are what keeps them hooked to the product. Designers take special care in ensuring that internal triggers are taken care in the user journey with the product.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;rewards&#34;&gt;Rewards&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rewards create a dopamine surge in the brain. Dopamine, often referred to as the pleasure hormone, plays a vital role in how we feel. It helps us strive, focus and find things interesting. Higher the dopamine surge, higher the pleasure. As dopamine gets released, we surpass the brain’s decision and judgement areas and activate the parts associated with want and desire. So, if dopamine is released by doing some action then that action is directly associated with our wants and desires. And because of this association we want to do that action again in anticipation of the reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And introducing variability in rewards simply multiplies this effect. In addition, variability in rewards activates the nucleus accumbens region in our brain and spikes the levels of the neurotransmitter Dopamine, driving our hungry search for rewards further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the products use this rewarding mechanism to keep the users glued. There three types of variable rewards which Product Designers incorporate in their designs: Reward bythe Tribe, Reward by the Hunt, Reward by the Self&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tribe:&lt;/strong&gt; We look for rewards in the form of social recognition or acceptance from our tribe, from those who are like us. We are more likely to alter our behaviours and beliefs if we see others who are more like ourselves being rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;example-likes-and-comments-on-facebook-upvotes-and-badges-on-stackoverflow&#34;&gt;Example: Likes and comments on Facebook, upvotes and badges on Stackoverflow&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunt:&lt;/strong&gt; Variable reward which is given after the completion of a task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;example-the-outcome-on-the-gambling-machine-after-spinning-it-total-points-accumulated-after-playing-a-round-of-candy-crush&#34;&gt;Example: The outcome on the gambling machine after spinning it, total points accumulated after playing a round of Candy Crush&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a very personal form of gratification. These are fueled by intrinsic motivation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;example-you-feel-happy-about-3-kills-in-pubg-today-compared-to-only-1-kill-yesterday&#34;&gt;Example: You feel happy about 3 kills in PUBG today compared to only 1 kill yesterday&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies spend a lot of time and effort in designing the perfect model of variable rewards. Variable rewards are not some magic fairy dust to sprinkle on the products, they are carefully designed considering why a particular user uses a product and what kind of variable reward aligns with the user’s internal triggers and motivations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the last step in the Hook Model: &lt;strong&gt;Investments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;investments&#34;&gt;Investments&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above variable rewards combined with the investment of user’s time and effort into the product makes the user come back to the product again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons why we tend to go back to the product again and again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tend to value things more which we’ve created/put in our efforts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We tend to repeat our past behaviours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to go back to the same product again and again because we have already invested our time or money or effort or emotions into it. The idea behind the investment phase is to leverage a user’s belief that the service will get better over time with further use and personal investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples of different investments users make:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Content: Youtube, TikTok, Facebook&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data: Linkedin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knowledge: Medium, Substack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotions: Instagram Stories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money: Netflix Premium, Spotify Premium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is pretty much this habit-forming cycle of Trigger-Action-Variable Reward-Investment that keeps us hooked to a particular product and makes us go back to it again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the rest of the article, you can find some related heuristics about this habit-forming cycle. In no particular order, I have provided some insights drawn in bits and pieces from the book: some experiments, theories and anecdotes related to this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;foggs-model-for-human-behaviour&#34;&gt;Fogg’s Model for human behaviour:**&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Fogg’s model, any user behaviour depends on three things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User’s motivation to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User’s ability to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User’s trigger to do&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, Fogg represents this by equation B = MAT. So, the behaviour is a product of Motivation, Ability and Trigger. If any of these is not present or is insufficient then the user will not cross the line to take an action and thus not form a habit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Three Core Motivators in human beings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek pleasure and avoid pain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek hope and avoid fear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek social acceptance and avoid rejection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The factors that influence the ability to do a task are time, money, physical effort, mental effort, social acceptance, non-routineness of a task. It is found that the product designers focus on easing the scarciest resource at the moment of deciding to do a task or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influencing behaviour by reducing the effort required to act is more effective than increasing someone’s desire to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;example-you-will-find-that-the-buy-now-button-on-amazon-will-be-of-same-colour-shape-and-design-across-the-website-this-is-to-reduce-the-mental-effort-by-the-user-to-process-what-that-button-means-you-need-to-process-it-only-once-when-you-visit-amazon-for-the-first-time-every-other-time-you-know-what-that-button-means-and-hence-you-are-eased-of-that-mental-effort&#34;&gt;Example: You will find that the ‘Buy Now’ button on Amazon will be of same colour, shape and design across the website. This is to reduce the mental effort by the user to process what that button means. You need to process it only once, when you visit Amazon for the first time. Every other time, you know what that button means and hence you are eased of that mental effort.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trigger:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I discussed Triggers earlier in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-common-heuristics&#34;&gt;Other Common Heuristics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some common heuristics which businesses typically make use of to trigger behaviours. As we see below, these heuristics are designed so that people make split-second decisions every day and yet remain unaware of how they are influenced in making those decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scarcity effect:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
People associate more value to the things that are scarce. A study by Worchel, Lee, and Adewole showed that the perceived value of scarcer items was more than the items in abundance, though the items were the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;example-this-effect-is-used-by-online-retailers-like-amazon-only-14-items-in-the-stock&#34;&gt;Example: This effect is used by online retailers like Amazon: ‘Only 14 items in the stock.’&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cool point in this context is that the perceived value increases as the product once abundant gradually becomes scarce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;example-this-is-seen-in-tele-shopping-where-products-are-sold-on-tv-in-this-the-product-advertised-will-start-with-qty-1000-available-and-the-number-is-gradually-reduced-as-the-number-reduces-from-1000-to-700-to-500-the-viewers-attach-more-value-to-the-product-and-tend-to-place-the-order&#34;&gt;Example: This is seen in Tele Shopping where products are sold on TV. In this, the product advertised will start with ‘Qty: 1000 available’ and the number is gradually reduced. As the number reduces from 1000 to 700 to 500, the viewers attach more value to the product and tend to place the order.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Anchoring Effect:&lt;/strong&gt;
We get transfixed to something that is shown to us directly. We tend to believe it to be true on instinct and do not notice other things happening around us or question other things — we are too lazy to pay attention or question our instincts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;example-you-walk-into-a-shopping-mall-and-see-the-50-off-signboard-and-instinctively-go-towards-that-you-rarely-question-what-that-50-off-actually-means-in-most-cases-50-off-is-given-as-part-of-a-clearance-sale-on-old-products-or-on-some-other-products-which-you-wouldnt-otherwise-purchase-the-idea-here-is-to-get-your-foot-in-the-door-once-there-the-shopkeeper-will-try-and-sell-other-costly-products-to-you&#34;&gt;Example: You walk into a shopping mall and see the ‘50% Off’ signboard and instinctively go towards that. You rarely question what that 50% Off actually means. In most cases, 50% Off is given as part of a clearance sale on old products or on some other products which you wouldn’t otherwise purchase. The idea here is to get your foot in the door. Once there, the shopkeeper will try and sell other ‘costly’ products to you.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Endowed Progress Effect:&lt;/strong&gt;
People tend to put more effort to reach a goal if they believe that they have made progress or are making progress towards that goal. It is a phenomenon that increases motivation as people believe that they can achieve the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;example-to-make-more-people-update-their-profile-linkedin-uses-the-profile-strength-progress-bar-as-you-notice-that-your-profile-is-only-50-complete-you-intrinsically-yearn-to-fill-in-more-details-and-hit-a-higher-number-on-the-progress-bar&#34;&gt;Example: To make more people update their profile, Linkedin uses the profile strength progress bar. As you notice that your profile is only 50% complete, you intrinsically yearn to fill in more details and hit a higher number on the progress bar.&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Framing Effect:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The environment in which a product or value is delivered affects the way the value is perceived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;example-a-musician-playing-in-a-paid-concert-will-be-valued-more-compared-to-the-same-musician-playing-in-a-subway-for-free-another-example-the-same-wine-from-a-bottle-tagged-1000-will-taste-better-than-that-from-a-bottle-tagged-100&#34;&gt;Example: A musician playing in a paid concert will be valued more compared to the same musician playing in a subway for free. Another example, the same wine from a bottle tagged $1,000 will taste better than that from a bottle tagged $100!&lt;/h5&gt;
