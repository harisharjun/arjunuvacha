        <description>&lt;img src="https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/my-aunty-my-guru/guru.jpg" alt="Featured image of post My Aunty, my Guru" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How I was fortunate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It was the year 2001. My mother had already left her job in the school as a schoolteacher to pursue home tailoring in the hope that she would generate a better income by having her tailoring set up than being a teacher at a school. My father was trying to fix his private enterprise which did not have any steady flow of income. We were barely managing to make our ends meet as a family. My elder brother was in the ninth standard, my elder sister and I both were in the seventh standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a typical lower-middle-class family that we were, we tried our best to maximise any opportunity that we received. And luckily for me, I somehow managed to perform well in academics. However, paying fees every month was not easy. So, as it happened my mother explored different avenues to lessen the financial burden every month: both household expenses and our school fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably is God’s will that she one day got to know about someone called ‘Sairam’ Aunty, who helped children with books, clothes, education and other basic needs. Without letting this opportunity go in vain she took us to her house, in the hope of getting free tuition and other supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the first time I met Aunty. I did not know her name then and also for quite sometime after joining the tuition. She was still ‘Sairam’ Aunty or just ‘Aunty’ for me (and a lot of other kids) and that was sufficient. The idea of getting free tuition, books and clothes paved my way for getting into her abode. Little did I know then that what I thought I got for free then was minuscule compared to what I would eventually receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I owe a major part of my transformation from being a shabby and foul 12-year-old, 7th standard child to becoming the better human that I am today. If not for her, I probably would have still made it big in life, but not better. And that difference, the difference between big and better is what I learnt under her guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It probably won’t be possible for me to describe, in words, the immense contribution Aunty has done in my life. I will try, nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting into her fold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From a noisy neighbourhood of Rasoolpura, getting into Aunty‘s house brought about a different kind of calm and pleasant experience. When I went to her house for the first time, I saw a variety of students already sitting there. Some kids younger than me, many of my age and also some elders, predominantly girls. All of us were from the same locality, in and around Rasoolpura, and mostly belonged to modest family backgrounds. No matter what the mix was, I got to meet new people and make new friends at Aunty’s house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all went to her house daily. It was as if going to Aunty’shouse was part of our daily routine. Over time I realised that it was not just tuitions that we all went to Aunty. There were a lot of other activities that happened along the way, which shaped me and all the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our regular tuitions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Daily in the evening from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM we had our tuition classes. Aunty religiously spent time in the evening every day teaching kids of various classes. She took turns calling children from the same class, giving them portions to learn from a topic and also conducting tests regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She spent 3 to 3 1/2 hours daily helping children learn free of cost, as a form of service. It wasn’t just a shelter for most of us where we simply went to spend time. We were held responsible for what we did, what we learnt, and how we spent our time. Aunty diligently followed up with us and checked our progress. Though it was a free service from Aunty without any financial implications, we all were inherently made responsible for our education and did not take it for granted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At her fold, receiving support for the secular/school education was just one of the activities. Apart from that, we spent a considerable amount of time doing things that helped us make progress spiritually too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly Balavikas Classes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Every Sunday, Aunty conducted Balavikas classes. Balavikas classes were my favourite. I felt happy after attending the classes. As the word itself implies, Balavikas means ‘Development of a child’. It was precisely that, and under Aunty, it was even more comfortable and fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way Aunty conducted classes, they were a blend of stories, life lessons and fun-filled activities. For a child who was just about 12 years of age, a few games and some stories were a crowd puller and Aunty ensured that every child was having fun with a fair amount of entertainment along with smartly infused lessons and values for life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Balavikas classes were conducted for about an hour every Sunday in the evening. They typically started with a story, followed by a few games or puzzles and then by some Shlokas and concluded with Bhajans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories were either from Swami’s Chinna Katha series or from the scriptures - The Ramayan or The Mahabharata or The Bhagavatham or other stories narrated by Swami himself. Through these stories, we were told of our rich history, the greatness of our past and lessons and values from our scriptures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time a story was told, we were made to ponder on the leanings from it and how could we apply them in our daily life. All those stories guided us in developing a sense of moral responsibility, in distinguishing right from wrong, in choosing what to do and what not to do, wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not as if it mattered so much for us as children. But we would eventually become adults. And that mattered. Aunty was not just telling moral stories to children. She knew she was shaping all of us to become better adults, better citizens and better humans. She was teaching us values, so that one day when we grow up, we know how to conduct ourselves - for ourselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another interesting part of Balavikas classes that I particularly liked was the fun games and puzzles part. The games included quizzes based on our scriptures, board games like crosswords, snakes and ladders, and puzzles. All the games were so designed that they offered not just fun, but also presented human values for life. Some games were even designed by Aunty to better suit the age group attending the classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If not for her value-based stories and fun-filled games during the Balavikas classes, I would have compromised myself. And the sad part would not be that I compromised; the sad part would be that I wouldn’t have even known that I compromised myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bhajans at Aunty’s house&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We had weekly Bhajans every Thursday and monthly Bhajans on the second Tuesday every month. Bhajans not only helped us relax from the regular study schedule but also made us do the ‘Namasmaran’ of God. For an otherwise wandering mind, Bhajans helped focus on a single thing for a brief amount of time. The effects of doing Namasmaran, just like doing any Sadhana, were so subtle and transformative that I did not realise how I had better control over my tongue over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though bad at singing, I was allowed to sing Bhajans once in a while. I was scared initially. Singing, especially in front of 20-30 other people, was something that I had never done in my life. But Aunty helped me push out of my comfort zone, she trained me and made me do the impossible. That boosted my confidence to present myself in front of an audience and made me a confident person. If not for her, it would have taken me many more years to break out of my self-contained bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, at the end of every Bhajan, we gave Aarthi to Bhagwan. It was either Aunty or Uncle who usual performed Aarthi, but given any special occasion, the students also got an opportunity and that moment was a moment of joy. It was quite a privilege to give Aarthi. But getting the privilege was not easy! We had to do something extraordinary to deserve the chance. Something like, getting first place in the school final exams or winning cultural or sports competitions at the school or doing well at a district level or state level competition. Though doing Bhajans had its inherent perks, the opportunity to give Aarthi fuelled us to excel in other areas as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monthly Narayana Seva&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Another regular activity for us was the monthly Narayana Seva which happened on the third Sunday every month. The Narayana Seva was conducted as part of the service activities of Sri Sathya Sai Seva Organisations by the Begumpet Samithi. Under the guidance of Swami (Sri Sathya Sai Baba), Narayana Seva formed a core part of the ‘Serve All’ mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once a month, we provided medical aid, food and clothing to the needy and the underprivileged. All these people gathered in the old airport premises and we had the opportunity to serve them irrespective of their age or background or community. A bunch of Aunty’s students participated in these service activities religiously, month on month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were involved in cleaning the premises, vegetable cutting, setting up the tents, arranging chairs, providing help for cooking food in large quantities, assisting in medicine distribution, guiding the visitors with relevant information, offering prayers and doing bhajans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it was a sort of a break from the regular affairs of school, TV and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never did we think of doing these extra activities as a burden or struggle. I think we derived joy out of helping others because we inherently knew that it was our way of paying back for receiving free tuition, books, life lessons and whatnot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Aunty’s students have imbibed this quality to ‘help others and serve others’. This can be largely attributed to the monthly Narayana Seva in which we participated and offered our service selflessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, when you’re a kid you don’t realise all these happening to you. You don’t realise the importance of service or offering help to someone. At that age, things just happen to you because of the environment you are in, and before you know it, your life has already been shaped by all the events in that environment. Such was my case too. I did not realise how important and transformational these activities were but they have changed me as a person, none of which was possible without Aunty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Becoming a better person&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Another aspect that I was privileged to witness under Aunty’s guidance was her constant pursuit to do good and be the best version of myself. She has personally made me push myself further and farther and in the right direction. At a time when there were not many in my life to guide me on the right path, Aunty was always there. She, time and again, helped me make the right decisions. Her wish and desire for me to do well is something I cannot even explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me to do well, she wanted me to study in the Sri Sathya Sai Higher Secondary School, Puttaparthi. So, during my 10th grade, I sent my application to SSSHSS. I waited in great hope for a response from the institute. But unfortunately, my application was not accepted. I still remember my feeling that day. I felt bad and I cried. I felt like an underachiever and was running low on my confidence. But Aunty’s words and motivation gave me the courage and confidence to work harder and improve myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If not Higher Secondary School, we can try again later. Swami has some other plans for you,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gained myself, worked harder and got into NIT Warangal. It was a moment of pride for Aunty and I felt good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I had to go to Warangal, I couldn’t meet Aunty so often during my engineering days. But I tried to visit her whenever I came to Hyderabad. I informed her of my progress and sought her guidance whenever needed. During one of the semesters, we didn’t have enough money to pay the hostel fees. At my mother’s request, Aunty arranged for financial help and I couldn’t thank her enough for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the campus placements at NIT Warangal, I got placed. It was on November 23rd, Swami’s birthday. Aunty was elated when I shared the news. After congratulating me, she asked if I would be interested to pursue an MBA at Swami’s college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Why don’t you apply for an MBA there,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not have any plans to do an MBA till then. At NIT Warangal, I just focused on getting a job and was excited that I got placed at one of the top Communications &amp;amp; Networking companies in the world. But I also knew that after missing out on my selection for Higher Secondary School, there was an unfulfilled void in me that wanted me to pursue some form of education in any of the Sai Schools. So, I thought of giving it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not for doing an MBA that I wanted to apply. I just wanted to study in a Sai School, under Swami’s direct instructions. So I applied. After my application was selected I went through their selection process - Aptitude Test, Group Discussion and an in-person interview. I again waited for the results and this time I was selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took Aunty’s blessings and went on to complete my MBA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBA at Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher changed my perspective towards life. It helped me become a better human being. And this was only possible because Aunty knew that this was the best for me. Though I reap the fruits of doing an MBA at Puttaparthi, it was her will, her wish and her dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I stand where I am today and look back, I owe a lot of my successes and achievements to Aunty. She stood there for me, guiding me, wishing the best for me and praying for my well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe, her blessings and love will always be there by my side. And every part of my happiness will be shared by her too, always. With this constant belief, I will always strive to do my best and make her proud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you, Aunty. I am today because you were.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/things-that-made-me-smile-part-02/smile2.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Things That Made Me Smile - Part 02" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello!👋🏼&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think that you are having or have had a tough time in your career, finding a job or choosing one, be assured that you are not alone. There are a plenty of others who are just like you and like me, riding this turbulent wave. In fact, I reckon that all those who are reading this have had their share of soul searching too amidst the job search!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to talk about a few memorable experiences I have had in my corporate journey. I hope you relate to them 🤞🏼&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This is the second in a series of articles on &lt;strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;things that made me smile&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read the first part, please read: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/things-that-made-me-smile-part-o1&#34; &gt;Part 01&lt;/a&gt; ✅&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-tale-of-becoming-a-treeb&#34;&gt;The tale of becoming a Treeb&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worked on our startup &lt;em&gt;WhatsDplan&lt;/em&gt; for more than 18 months when we decided to call it a day. After we decided to shut down our operations at WhatsDplan, I had to find another job. I already had a bruising experience at finding jobs after my MBA and I just knew that finding a job again was not going to be easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew I was passionate about building products and wanted to try hard to get into some kind of a Product role - even as an associate or as an analyst. But the search ahead was going to be another turbulent ride, I realised later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applied for all the startups (funded!) in Hyderabad and in Bengaluru - I went to their website, noted their ‘career’ email id and wrote them an email. All my attempts were futile. I did not get even a single response. It made me wonder whether those emails were checked by any recruiter at all! I asked some of my friends from NITW and also reached out to some of the founders in my network if they could refer me to any company. Some of them tried, some of them didn’t. But all the attempts did not get me even a single call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then thought of broadening my search. Thought of keeping myself open for other roles as well. I thought Sales is one option that would help me do a customer-facing job and gain insights around user behaviour, needs and also about the market in general. Though I wanted to get into Product, I thought that even Sales gave me a lot of avenues to explore, learn and understand. Also, there was some amount of pressure from the family, and the people around in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I was just out of a ‘failed’ startup, so I wanted to validate myself, test myself again. See if I could really add some value to any company and contribute something tangible in any way possible. I mean, when you are going through a rough phase in your life even the smallest of achievements and the smallest of applause seem miraculous, they give hope and instill the faith again that life will still go on. They say, ‘doobne waale ko tinke ki sahara hi bohut hoti hai’ (even a tiny twig is enough for a drowning man). I too felt like a drowning man, searching for that ‘tinka’, that light at the end of the tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out to a few of my friends again, saying I was open to Sales roles as well. I just hoped if I could get even a single call, just for the sake of it - to keep my morale afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a couple of days, Dos (Vijay Chander Dosapati, whom we call Dos) sent me a Territory Sales Manager profile at Treebo. It felt like a decent role and I applied for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though it was like one of the hundred emails and job applications I sent, it felt different. It just felt like it had some good vibe. I had to send an email to Sugandh Jalan, Cluster Head, Hyderabad. I drafted the email at around 5 PM in the evening, ensured that it had no grammatical errors and conveyed the message - my interest and competence clearly. I clicked ‘Send’. Read the email again, after sending. 🤷🏻‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sending the email, the anxiety and eagerness took over again. I tried not to worry too much about it, but I couldn’t. My heart skipped a beat at every email notification I received on my phone. After going through so many rejections, I just hoped this was different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was late in the night and I still did not get any response. I hoped that I may get a response the next day and tried to sleep. Suddenly my phone beeped. I saw a notification, a message from Sugandh. My heart skipped a beat again, this time even my breath heaved. I was scared, I guess, I did not check the message on my phone. I opened my laptop instead - trying to add some delay. (Do people even do such things!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I opened Gmail on my laptop, I saw an unread message with the first line, ‘Hi Arjun, Thanks for reaching out.’ I gathered some courage and opened it. ‘I have forwarded it to the HR, she will reach out to you shortly’, it read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I gave a sigh of relief, I was certain I would get an interview call now, thank god! After almost two years of joblessness (counting the time I spent on our startup), I finally got an interview call, finally! Wow! This was my first interview call after 3 and a half years, so I was both excited and anxious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to do my absolute best but was also worried a little as it was for a Sales role, for which I did not have much experience, technically. Though I ran Sales, Operations and everything business/product in our startup, I was not sure how much of that experience would be considered in this interview (I just didn’t know then. Now, I know it counted a lot!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HR called within a couple of days. She explained to me the selection process - two rounds of interviews, one on phone and another in person. She also asked me about my interest in joining Treebo, educational and work experience, the startup journey, last drawn CTC (which I disclosed naively. &lt;em&gt;Pro tip: Never disclose your CTC in the first call!&lt;/em&gt;) among other things. She was checking my communication skills and culture fit, perhaps. ‘I will schedule your first round in the next week’, she concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first round was with Akhil Gupta, Cluster Head Mumbai. I did some research on Linkedin, tried to gather more details that could help me in the interview - any regional affiliations or common connections - nothing. No help there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day of the interview arrived and I got a call. I felt that it was like a casual conversation. I was asked a few questions about my startup and my interest in Sales, for which I was thoroughly prepared. I answered rather easily. He then asked me about my location preference, my expectations, about the hospitality industry, how I increased Sales at our startup, why we quit the startup among other things. It went fine, I was not intimidated and answered as if I already knew the question paper before the exam. I was confident I would get through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HR called the next day and confirmed my selection into the next round - an in-person interview with Sugandh, three days from then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the day. I wore a light coloured shirt gifted by Divya Ganti, it was some shade of pink - I’d have to do some research to give the name of the exact colour! The colour coincidentally matched with the file I was carrying - the file was Ramesh’s, which I took and never returned. I guess, it simply feels good to use something which belongs to a friend, knowing that he/she wouldn’t mind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that I won’t be late I started early and took a cab to Vamsiram’s Jyothi Square, Banjara Hills. I tried to maintain composure all along the cab ride and tried not to bite my nails (I have this super bad habit of biting nails!). Crossed my legs and tried to relax. I noticed that my shoes (which I wore in Chennai while working at Standard Chartered) were worn out. ‘Would this affect my overall presentation? Presentation is crucial in Sales, isn’t it?’ I thought&amp;hellip; Mind is a monkey, you see!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I reached the destination about 10 minutes early. The office building was more of a residential apartment rented out to offices, rather than a full-fledged corporate building. As I entered the building’s parking space, I saw a board listing all the offices there. ‘Treebo Hotels - 4B’, I read and took the elevator to the 4th floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fidgeted with my file all the way to the 4th floor, adjusted my shirt and my sleeves and stepped out of the elevator. ‘4B’, I saw, as soon as I stepped out and was taken aback a little. The entrance into the office was a door, just like a regular door to our houses with a knob to push and twist to open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath, pushed the button and twisted the knob. Nothing happened. My palms were sweaty.  I rubbed them against the dark coloured pant I was wearing and tried to twist the knob again. It didn’t turn! I pushed the button harder this time and tried again. It didn’t budge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I released it, took a step back and tried to examine it. I wondered if I was doing anything wrong! I pushed the button again and rotated the knob the other way round this time. Nothing happened. All of this was adding to my anxiety and then suddenly my phone rang. I was startled. I took the phone out of my pocket, ‘Sugandh Treebo’, it read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Hi Sugandh’, I picked the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Hey Arjun, I am just on my way to the office. I will reach in another 15 minutes, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Oh, okay. I just reached’, I replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Cool, you can wait on the 4th floor’, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Sure’, I said and he cut the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at the knob again and nodded my head acknowledging the unnecessary suspense it created. I tried to relax a bit. I waited there in the corridor, staring down a large window in the corner. I looked at the vehicles and pedestrians passing by in the hot summer afternoon and tried to calm my anxious self. ‘Time passed rather slowly’, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elevator chimed finally and out came Sugandh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Hi Arjun’, he said taking the keys out of his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Hi Sugandh, how are you?’ I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I am good. How about you?’ he replied trying to open the door - pushing and twisting the knob, just like what I did a while ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I am good too. Excited about the interview’, I tried to build some conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Sure’, he said and entered the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed him inside. It was one open hall with a few cabins and one conference room in the corner. Entering a closed room in the summer had a compelling effect, Sugandh turned on the air conditioner immediately. He entered the conference room, placed his bag on the table and called me in. He sat at one side of the table and asked me to sit on the other side. I placed my file on the table and sat opposite to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘So Arjun, tell me about yourself’, he asked nonchalantly, flipping the pages in my file. I too gave a regular answer which I almost memorized word-by-word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He spent a few moments and studied my profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Are you sure you want to apply for Sales? You are fit for a Product role’, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised when he said that and was happy that somebody felt I had a profile fit for a Product role. I never expected a hiring manager to say that to me during an interview. Amidst this I had a sudden rush of adrenaline - I wondered if this could turn into a Product interview, that made me worry a bit as I was not prepared for a Product interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Well, even I tried for Product roles over the past few months but couldn’t get any call so far. Even at Treebo, I couldn’t find any Product opening. So, I opened myself for other opportunities as well’, I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Ok. Let me talk to the HR’, he said dialling on his keypad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat there with a mixed bag of emotions - I was happy that someone thought of considering me for a Product role, a bit perplexed as the hiring manager was calling the HR during the interview and worried if it would turn into a Product interview for which I wasn’t prepared. And it was all happening at once, suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sugandh spoke to the HR, informed about the ongoing interview and enquired if there were any Product openings. He then listened to the response from the other side and cut the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yaar, we don’t have any Product openings right now. Let’s do one thing, I will go ahead with this interview and if everything goes well we can relook at moving you into Product after a few months’, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Sure!’ I agreed, relieved and sad at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Why Sales?’ he then asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My idea was to do a customer-facing role that would give good exposure to user needs and also understand the market better - something that I felt I lacked during our startup. I told him the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then gave me a couple of situations to roleplay, he was the customer and I had to sell him the product. From my experience at the startup and knowledge from a few movies about how Sales was done, I tried to talk about the features of the product and persuaded him a little. My pitch was not so convincing, I thought. It would be entirely different if I had to do it now. But I answered all his queries about the product and explained how it would benefit him over other products he was using. He nodded in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then gave some monthly numbers of a hotel: total expenses, average occupancy, sales margin, average room price and asked me to determine the optimal revenue strategy. I did some calculations and explained to him my projections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He inquired further about my date of joining and if I was willing to relocate to Bengaluru if required. After discussing these for a while he asked the most important question of all - my expected CTC. I could give 100 tips on how to negotiate a salary now, but back then I was exposed and naive, I did not do well in that area. I gave a number and Sugandh immediately said that it was not possible - a negotiation tactic, perhaps. I tried to explain my point but he said they could give only so much increase over the last drawn CTC (I had disclosed the last drawn CTC earlier, remember? 🤦🏻‍♂️)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a tricky situation for me. I kind of nodded in agreement but tried to ask more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Anyway, let me check with the team about it!’ he snapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Ok, sure’, I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then asked about my family, where I lived, how I would commute etc. He told that that was it, the interview was over. I thanked him and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the way back, I felt good that the interview went well, but was a little apprehensive about the salary at the same time. ‘What if they trick me because of my situation and offer me too low a salary’, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like any candidate after an interview, I too was restless with bursts of annoyance and excitement for the next few days. But I had no other option, I had just had to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Hi Arjun, Archana here from Treebo’, I finally got a call after about 4-5 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Hi Archana’, I replied becoming alert at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘So, we’re glad to inform you that you have been selected for the role’, she said with a hint of calmness in her tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Oh ok, thanks!’ I said, trying to hide my emotions too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘After discussing with the team and Sugandh, we’d like to offer you this…’, she quoted a figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pleasantly surprised and couldn’t contain my smile as it was higher than what I had hoped for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Ok, so is that the final offer?’ I asked, knowing it was a stupid question and regretted it instantly. I mean, I did not know what else to say and knew her response too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I think this is on par with your expectations, right?’ she replied unapologetically, as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yes, yes’, I assured her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘So, if you are fine with it, I can send you the offer letter immediately’, she sought my confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Umm… Yes, I think I would like to go ahead with the offer’, I confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Great! I will send you an email, please confirm on that’, she said with a pleasant tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Ok, sure’, I agreed and went inside my room, opened my laptop and kept staring at the screen, waiting for the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the laptop took a photo that time, I would have had a portrait of what I’d call, ‘relaxed smile’ with me today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to be continued&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/things-that-made-me-smile-part-01/smile.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Things That Made Me Smile - Part 01" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you try to find your place in this world, you are busy &amp;mdash; either doing something or trying to figure out whether to do it or not. In this pursuit, you sometimes figure your way out and sometimes you simply get lost. And if you are fortunate enough you’ll find some precious moments along the way, moments that make you smile, even in the most mundane of activities. It is probably those tiny little things that help you get along with a lot of other not-so-tiny ones. Ever thought so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like you, I too have had a fair share of some such priceless moments, reminiscing of which simply gives me joy. So, for the joy I derive out of reminiscing, I&amp;rsquo;ve compiled some such personal stories. Stories that made me think and wonder and smile and most importantly taught me to be grateful for everything around me. That it is these tiny, little moments brushing past us unnoticeably which truly make us and define us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope they bring a smile to your face too. 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-tale-of-two-5th-graders&#34;&gt;The tale of two 5th graders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I studied at Kasturba High School in Rasool Pura, Hyderabad. It was a decent English medium school in our locality, walkable from our home. It was so close that I used to come home every day for lunch and then go back to school again. Almost all the students were from in and around the same area only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all were not from high earning families and most of my friends struggled to pay the school fees in time. Having pocket money in those days was a luxury. Even a single Rupee in the pocket was like a privilege. It was very unusual for us to get money from our parents, so whenever we somehow managed to get any money, we got ecstatic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during my 5th grade. Our lunch break was from 12 PM to 1 PM and most of us went home to have lunch. On our way back to school after lunch, some of our parents gave us a Rupee or two, sometimes, if we got lucky! So, we bought candies, chips, tamarind sticks, lollipops or anything that fit our budget on our way back to school. However, that happened very rarely with me as I didn&amp;rsquo;t get pocket money quite as often as others!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, for me, however, one of my friends, Naresh, used to get money from his parents more often than I did. We both used to sit together in the third row, and I was the lucky one to get a share of what he bought after lunch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, after our lunch break I came early to the class. Other students entered, but there was no sign of Naresh. Our social teacher also entered the classroom and started the lecture. ‘Would he come?’ I wondered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class was almost silent &amp;mdash; post-lunch drowsiness already kicked in probably. The teacher was saying something about India and its states. Social was not my favourite subject, but I tried to listen to the lecture anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘May I come in, sir?’ I heard a familiar voice. Sir nodded his head and Naresh entered the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a little relieved. My focus suddenly shifted and all I could do at that moment was justify why he was late. ‘He’s late probably because he had to go to the &lt;em&gt;Kirana&lt;/em&gt; store nearby and buy some candies!’ I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he approached the desk, I grew more anxious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Did you get something?’ I whispered as he sat down.&lt;br&gt;
‘What?’ he questioned.&lt;br&gt;
‘Did you get something to eat?’ I whispered a little louder.&lt;br&gt;
He nodded in disapproval, with a slight disappointment on his face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smiled back and continued to listen to the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few moments into the class, I noticed that Naresh was trying to adjust himself and sit properly. As I squinted from the corner of my eye trying to figure out what he was up to he was still again, did not move. I continued with the class. Again, he was fidgeting around the desk. I turned completely this time, looking right at him. He had a huge smile on his face, and his right hand was inside his pocket. I heard feeble sounds of wrapper crackling and kept staring at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then raised his eyebrows and tried to pull something out of his pocket. The moment I realised that he was about to take something out, a loud giggle erupted from my mouth. My eyes twinkled with joy and my face was full of smiles as I saw a big packet of masala chips emerge out of his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He gently laid the packet onto the lower shelf of our double desk and pushed it towards me. I smiled in all the glory and grabbed the packet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a struggle to finish eating those chips during the classes that day, but we did our job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-tale-of-my-ride-to-the-college&#34;&gt;The tale of my ride to the college&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few years, I was in my 12th. My college was in SR Nagar, a bustling locality full of colleges and students aspiring to get into the IITs and NITs. It was about 4KM from my home. I walked from my home to the bus stop, took a bus to SR Nagar and then walked again for about 10 minutes to reach the college.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I got late for the class. You know, one or the other reason held me back. Sometimes, I started late from home because my mom wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have packed the lunch box. Sometimes the buses didn’t come on time or I try to avoid getting into them because they were overcrowded. Or the worst, there just was too much traffic to cause the delay. No matter what the reason was, I did not enjoy being late. But it was like a curse for me, I just couldn’t avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first class was Physics. Though I did well in the class, my Physics teacher, whom we called Shankar Sir, was a bit annoyed that I used to be late. There were instances of being late by more than 10 minutes, so he had all the right to be annoyed! Though it was not a regular affair, I too felt embarrassed as I entered the class when I was late, with everyone staring at me, giggling and smiling all they could!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried my best not to be late, but things just don’t work your way always, do they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, just like any other day, I was doing my bit to reach the college on time. I started early from my home, reached the bus stop well before my usual time. And waited. I was very confident that I’d make it in time that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept staring down the road, towards my right, checking the bus numbers hoping one of them would be mine. I waited for a good 10 minutes &amp;mdash; shifting my weight from one leg to the other, adjusting my backpack, glancing people move around. Still, there was no sign of my bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was growing a little restless I heard a voice from my behind calling out my name loudly. ‘Who would call me, at the bus stop,’ I ignored. I heard my name again, this time followed by a couple of claps. I reluctantly turned around and was surprised to see my Physics teacher waving his hand and calling out my name. I very gently raised my hand as if I was trying to say, ‘Present, sir’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He signalled me to hurry up and get inside his car. He had recently bought a brand new Hyundai Santro, the car still had a temporary registration number plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I felt a little hesitant and didn’t quite know what to do. He signalled again, with his hand, gesturing me to come fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was joyous from the inside. There he was, my Physics teacher, offering me a lift! I controlled myself from smiling too much, walked towards him, wished him good morning and got into the car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a silent ride for the most part, except when my teacher asked me about my family, my whereabouts and how I commuted daily. I answered and gave him an occasional smile as if trying to say, &amp;rsquo;thank you, sir.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about 12 minutes, we reached our college. &amp;lsquo;Coming to the college in a car felt a lot different,&amp;rsquo; I thought. When we reached the college, he parked the car inside the campus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the busiest hour of the day with all the students and the faculty reaching the college around that time. I had to get out of the car amidst all this, and I was shy and jubilant at the same time. As I got out of the car, the same people who caused me embarrassment in the class looked at me in awe. The bewilderment was palpable and I just couldn’t control blushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to the Physics class was not the same again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-tale-of-an-unbooked-train-ticket&#34;&gt;The tale of an unbooked train ticket&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few more years, I went on to study at NIT Warangal. I will cover other funny engineering stories in a separate post, this story is about the time of my graduation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cliched as it may sound, I joined MBA after engineering 🤷🏻‍♂️ and our graduation ceremony at NIT Warangal was announced after our MBA had started. By the way, I completed my MBA from Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning, Puttaparthi. The institute was rather very strict about students leaving the campus during the semester and had no-nonsense policies around taking leaves and not attending classes. So, I had to apply for leaves upfront and plan my journey. I applied for leave for exactly 3 days &amp;mdash; Friday, Saturday, and Monday and booked my onward journey tickets from Puttaparthi to Hyderabad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very excited about going to the graduation ceremony, as I would get to meet all my friends again! Another tidbit about SSSIHL, we had very little contact with the outside world during our semester. The only mode of communication with the outside world was email and a landline phone, believe me!! So, this added to the excitement even more, and I was eager to meet them. Some of them joined MBAs like me, but most of them took nice jobs offered during our campus placements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day of my journey arrived and I left Puttaparthi on Thursday evening and reached Hyderabad on Friday morning. In the evening, a bunch of us took the regular &lt;em&gt;Intercity-Express&lt;/em&gt; from Hyderabad to Warangal. It was nice meeting everyone again after such a long time. We reached the college and the excitement of graduation was everywhere, and the atmosphere was electric. The entire campus was fully decorated, welcoming us! The students had come from different parts of the country, coming back to the alma mater was always special and a matter of pride, after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all were having a superb time. After going around the campus for a while, we had our dinner and settled in our juniors&amp;rsquo; rooms :) to take some rest for the big event &amp;mdash; the graduation ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst all the partying and madness, there was a constant worry in my head. The plan was, we stay on the campus on Saturday (the day of graduation), leave for Hyderabad on Sunday afternoon or evening, and start back to Puttaparthi on Monday evening. The plan had to be followed meticulously, any delay otherwise would cause me trouble when I reached Puttaparthi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I had to start back to Puttaparthi on Monday evening, but I had not booked my return journey ticket! I was worried, not because I didn’t book but because I didn’t have enough money to book 😐
I felt terrible and hesitated to ask someone to book, I resisted myself. Although it seemed like the easiest thing to just ask a friend to book a ticket, I did not have the courage. I kept delaying it knowing for a fact that I still had a couple of more days to book. Anyway, as I did not have a way out yet I slept over it believing I could figure it out later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ceremony was in the evening, so we got up leisurely, wandered in the hostel, met more people, our batchmates and juniors. Enquired about college, the campus, our faculty, the placements. Made noise, had some unworried and carefree talk in the corridors till the evening. We then got ready for the event and went to the college auditorium. Our first graduation, we had a merry time! After about 6 hours of greetings, speeches, awards, prizes, photos, food, drinks, songs, dances and a lot of nonsense, we returned to the hostel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the dreadful hour had finally arrived. All of us started to talk about when we were returning to our respective places. As guys took turns, I just waited, a bit unsure, a bit worried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘I will be starting on Monday evening from Hyderabad’, I paused. ‘But, you know, I haven’t booked my return tickets yet. Hopefully, I will get to book them in Tatkal tomorrow!’ I said shrugging my shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Can someone help me book tickets tomorrow?’ I finally managed to mumble. After I said that, it felt like everyone just understood where I was coming from, my hesitation and my need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yea, I will do it ra!’ said Sai Thej.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was relieved. Asking for help never seemed so difficult!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I was a little anxious but was very hopeful that the ticket would get booked. And luck seemed to be with me, the ticket was booked. Sai Thej confirmed. I was so relieved that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even check the message I received on my phone. I just needed to hear that the ticket was booked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without stressing out too much about the return journey now, I had a good time with everyone around and we returned to Hyderabad that evening. Went home, spent some time with mom, showed the ‘NIT Warangal graduation degree certificate’ and talked about stuff in general, had dinner and slept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monday had arrived, my train was at 6 PM. I packed my luggage, the dinner box my mom prepared and some ironed white dresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, I started not too early and not too late. It was just about the right time! I reached the railway station and noticed that the train was already on the platform. I walked down the staircase to the platform and realised that I hadn’t checked my seat number! I quickly took out my phone, searched for messages from IRCTC in a hurry and found a message sent in the evening. ‘Chart prepared’ it read. I opened it and just couldn’t believe my eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message read ‘B3 27’. It took a moment for me to process it. I had always received messages which read something like ‘S7 34’. This was different. And then, after a few moments passed, it struck me. ‘That rascal had booked an AC ticket for me!’ I came to a standstill, almost about to cry… but then I smiled, and nodded my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I never thanked him for that, maybe it was never required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-tale-of-an-extraordinary-birthday&#34;&gt;The tale of an extraordinary birthday&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know the drill. Fast forward a few more years, enter the startup life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The years 2015 and 2016 were some of the most challenging years of my life. We were working on our startup ‘WhatsDplan’ at that time, and things were distraught. Though very gruelling at that time, I cherish them the most! This incident is one during that horrid period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were two of us working full-time along with a few others helping us out in building the startup. We had spent a good amount of time in 2015 and were reaching the end of 2016 without any significant result. Every day felt new. There was always something new to look forward to &amp;mdash; either good or bad. And I particularly didn’t mind either! It was such a state. There were no festivals, no holidays, no personal vacations or breaks of any sort. We were just under sheer grind, all the time, day-in and day-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we were approaching the last quarter of 2016, it occurred to me that my birthday was around the corner. With so many things happening around the startup which required our complete attention, we couldn’t care less about our birthdays! But we did celebrate a little, on Ramesh&amp;rsquo;s and Anoop&amp;rsquo;s (my friends from NITW, who were part of the startup) &amp;mdash; we cut a cake and had some casual fun, more like a distraction and a formality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, that year, my mom asked me to come home for the birthday &amp;mdash; she too was concerned that I was stressed out a lot and wanted me to have some break. That year, in 2016, my birthday was on a Monday. I thought I’ll go home on Sunday evening and return to the room (we were working out of a small rented apartment in Kukatpally) on Monday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew there would be some celebration at home. They too wanted to cheer me up. Like every birthday, mom made nice sumptuous meals and invited a few relatives and some neighbours for dinner. Just like many middle-class families, we too did not have a ‘gifting culture’ and birthday celebrations at home were not very fancy either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though I was not excited much, I was relieved a bit from the startup grind. I tried to enjoy as much as I could, knowing I had to get back to the grind the next day. Some people enquired about the startup, I gave an occasional and vague reply as I too didn’t quite have a very clear answer to most of the questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the evening approached we cut the cake and had our dinner. And I was then getting ready to leave. As I was packing my bag, dad came to me and took out a small box wrapped in paper from his pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My dad had never gifted me anything. Never. Ours was more of a strict father-son relationship and we too were not very particular about gifts. So when my dad handed me the box, it felt different. It felt special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standing there, I wondered, ‘of all these years, why’s dad giving me a gift now? Is it because he wanted to remind that he was there for support during the turbulent times of the startup or is that because he felt irresponsible for never giving any gift before!’ A flurry of thoughts just hit me. I tried to gather myself again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Oh! A gift this time!’ I said with a surprised look on my face, yet trying to keep it casual and took the gift from his hand.  He was excited and asked me to open it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Is it a pen?’ I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yes, yes. Open it!’ he rushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I opened it, I saw that it was a regular pen. Blue ink. Not too heavy like other branded pens, reserved for gifting. It was simple, nice, and dark. I lifted my hand as if trying to write in the air, clicked it a couple of times, made a nice tick-tock sound and smiled as my dad was standing there looking at my mannerisms. I looked at him and thanked him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘You know, there’s something special about this pen’, he sounded like he was revealing a secret to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Oh, is it?’ I questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took the pen from my hand, twisted the top part and pulled it away. The pen had changed its shape now. I was like, ‘well, what is it!’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stretched for my palm, stamped on it with the pulled away part and started smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked at my palm and noticed my name printed. ‘Harish Arjun’ it said, in nice, bold, calligraphy font. I couldn’t help but blurted out a burst of loud laughter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘So, I can &lt;em&gt;stamp&lt;/em&gt; my name now?’ I exclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Yes! You just need to stamp and put your signature now. No need of writing your name, you see,’ he said gleaming with joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just nodded in agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘Ok, then. I need to leave now,’ I said, ‘nice gift!’ And put the pen inside the box again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed my laptop, put it in the bag. Wore the bag around my shoulders, waved at my parents and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my right hand holding the bag strip around the shoulder, I was still holding the pen in my left hand. As I walked towards the bus stop, I kept smiling and nodding at the same time. It was late in the night and the bus wasn’t crowded. I entered the bus and was lucky to get a seat near the back window. With the bag on my lap now, I kept staring at the pen in my hand and smiled all the way from Rasool Pura to Kukatpally. Smiled in wonder and awe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smiled, and the smile was not just on my face this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/wait-to-not-give-up/waiting.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Wait, to not give up" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the exam results are out, your heart would skip a beat. It is natural to get anxious and you would get restless until you check the result. You quickly open the computer, search Google and get a list of websites. You will most probably click three or four links, thanks to Google. Any delay will add to those small moments of anxiety. What goes through your mind?  How do you feel when you type your hall ticket number and the page starts loading? What if the website is slow and is takes longer than usual to display your result?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of those moments when all you can do is just &lt;strong&gt;wait&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;hellip; for a few seconds or may be a minute, till you get to see your result. And you will finally get back to normalcy. Phew! Imagine if this phase is extended to an hour&amp;hellip; two hours&amp;hellip; a day or two! You may smash the computer screen! As you are able to read this, I guess you would have had your share of those stimulating hours of uncertainty, that anxiety, at some time or the other&amp;hellip; during cricket/football matches, distribution of test papers in class, placement results, dance competition results, while on the way to catch a train etc&amp;hellip; Just think!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2009, when I was in NIT Warangal, we had to organize the Freshers Event. It was our second year, and we were organizing it for the first time. We planned to get our batch T-Shirts printed and give it as Freshers gift. The T-Shirt design was ready and I was not sure of how to get it printed. The printer asked for .cdr format but we had .psd format ONLY - for the obvious reason that it was easy to get. Time was running out and the printer asked for a minimum of 15 days to print and deliver the shirts. We had allocated our budget for T-Shirts and everything was planned accordingly. So there was no going back and we had to find our way out. We ran down all the options: searched DC++ for the software, read stuff online and asked many seniors. &lt;strong&gt;Given the time, There was only one way out&amp;hellip;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember that night - I sat in our final year students&amp;rsquo; hostel verandah, waiting. I got a senior&amp;rsquo;s contact and was waiting for him. He was, then, the go-to-guy for T-Shirts in our college. I did not meet him before and he, obviously, did not know me. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure if he would help us, he sounded very reluctant on the phone. There was a little hope and  I was sitting there, waiting for him. I waited for about two hours and that felt like hell. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do anything else, but to wait. When I got restless I went to his room, for about 4 or 5 times only to find it locked. I had already bugged him by calling so many times that I did not take any chance to call him again. I read the hostel notice board, just to seem busy and avoid myself getting bullied by other seniors. The &amp;lsquo;guy&amp;rsquo; had come, finally! He saw me sitting on the bench and reluctantly asked for my pen drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went into his room, a typical B.Tech. final year student&amp;rsquo;s room&amp;hellip; you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know if a cloth on the floor was a towel or a door-mat! Anyway, he opened the file and checked the design. First thing he uttered: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Kya hai yaar ye&amp;hellip; itne saare&lt;/em&gt; layers and some are not even proper&amp;hellip; &lt;em&gt;Main merge bhi nahi kar sakta.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; (&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s this, dude? There are so many layers and some are not even proper. I can&amp;rsquo;t even merge them.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my first Photoshop design to go for printing, so there was no way for it to be professional! I had to quietly nod to whatever he said. &amp;ldquo;Abhi nahi hoga, it will take time.&amp;rdquo; - &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t do it now, it will take time.&amp;rdquo; But, it had to be sent to the printer without any further delay! I requested him&amp;hellip; pleaded him&amp;hellip; begged him - &lt;em&gt;bas pau pakadna baaki tha!&lt;/em&gt; and he finally agreed to be awake and do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was sitting behind him, quietly listening to his comments on how bad the file was and his suggestions for me. He did some rework on a few layers, added a few more layers and took the design into Corel Draw - saved it in .cdr format and gave it to me. Such a relief!! I was jubilant, felt like jumping and shouting! I thanked him and ran to my hostel, sent the file to the printer and Done! Wow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, during that phase, when there was no other option than to just wait and do nothing, I felt like my head will burst. &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s chuck the T-Shirts, we can give some other gift&amp;rdquo; - this thought occurred a hundred times. I wanted to fast forward time, to the next day and get away from that feeling. But, when the shirts arrived, just a day before the event, everyone was excited about them and there was JOY - when you see that in others&amp;hellip; believe me, all your efforts are paid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the hindsight, when I think about it again&amp;hellip; that time which I waited is in fact the most I cherish&lt;/strong&gt;. Had I not waited, we would have never got the shirts done. My friend still has one of those shirts with him which he still wears. I hope our juniors also might still have it. It&amp;rsquo;s a simple white print on a black cotton shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pic here&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s quite old now: 13 years! (as of 2021)&lt;/p&gt;
