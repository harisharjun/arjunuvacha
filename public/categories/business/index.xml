        <description>&lt;img src="https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/ai-the-product-intern-we-all-wanted/ai.webp" alt="Featured image of post AI: The product intern we all wanted" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;👋🏼 Hello! Thank you for stopping by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;😀 If you’re a product manager or an AI enthusiast, this article is for you. In this article, I have explored how AI is transforming the world of product management and how we, as leaders, can embrace this change to create a lasting impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we dive in, take a moment to reflect: Have you ever made a decision that felt more instinctual than data-driven? Or spent hours poring over routine tasks that seemed to pull you away from strategy and innovation? If so, you’re not alone. And here’s the good news — AI is here to help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s walk through how AI is reshaping three critical aspects of product management: decision-making, automating routine tasks, and creating deeply personalized customer experiences. Along the way, I’ll share a few stories and lessons to make it relatable. I hope they resonate with you as much as they do with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-the-shift-in-decision-making-with-ai&#34;&gt;🚀 The Shift in Decision-Making with AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I think of decision-making, I’m reminded of my early days as a product manager. Back then, decisions often relied on gut feeling, past experiences, and scattered data. But today, AI is changing the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-data-driven-decision-superpowers&#34;&gt;🧠 Data-Driven Decision Superpowers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI allows product managers to process massive amounts of data, uncovering patterns and insights that were once unimaginable. Imagine having a tool that not only identifies trends but also predicts what’s coming next. That’s what AI brings to the table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take, for instance, an Indian e-commerce platform targeting diverse customers across regions. With AI-powered analytics, the platform can identify that sarees are trending in Tamil Nadu while contemporary fashion is booming in Mumbai. Armed with these insights, PMs can align inventory and marketing strategies to meet regional demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on this, I’m reminded of Marty Cagan’s words: “The best product managers don’t just react to data; they use it to anticipate what’s next.” With AI, we can do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-real-time-insights-for-agile-management&#34;&gt;🕒 Real-Time Insights for Agile Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI tools provide real-time dashboards and predictive analytics, enabling us to monitor metrics and pivot quickly when needed. Picture a fintech PM in India receiving an AI-generated alert about a sudden drop in user engagement. Instead of waiting for a quarterly review, the PM can investigate immediately, ensuring swift action to address the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These real-time insights remind us that being proactive is key to staying ahead in a fast-paced market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-automating-routine-tasks-to-elevate-strategy&#34;&gt;🤖 Automating Routine Tasks to Elevate Strategy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it, we’ve all been there — stuck in the endless loop of managing backlogs, compiling user feedback, and updating roadmaps. While these tasks are important, they often leave little room for strategic thinking. That’s where AI steps in to save the day.

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-streamlining-market-research&#34;&gt;🔍 Streamlining Market Research&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market research, which used to take weeks, can now be done in minutes. AI tools equipped with Natural Language Processing (NLP) analyze reviews, social media chatter, and survey responses to extract actionable insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of a conversation with a PM friend working in consumer tech. He shared how an AI tool helped him uncover user pain points by analyzing thousands of online reviews. What would have taken weeks was done in a single afternoon — leaving him free to focus on designing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-simplifying-feedback-collection&#34;&gt;💬 Simplifying Feedback Collection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback collection is another area where AI shines. Imagine deploying a chatbot on your app to gather user feedback 24/7. The bot not only collects responses but also analyzes sentiment, categorizing feedback into themes. This eliminates the need for manual sorting and ensures no valuable insight is missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-enhancing-roadmap-management&#34;&gt;📅 Enhancing Roadmap Management&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With AI-enabled project management platforms, updating roadmaps and identifying dependencies becomes a breeze. I recall how a colleague once marveled at how his AI tool suggested optimal timelines for a multi-team project. The time saved allowed him to focus on building a compelling product vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-the-power-of-personalization-through-ai&#34;&gt;🌟 The Power of Personalization Through AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there’s one thing we all crave as customers, it’s personalization. AI takes this to a whole new level, enabling PMs to create deeply tailored experiences that resonate with users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-advanced-customer-segmentation&#34;&gt;🎯 Advanced Customer Segmentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI dives deep into user data, segmenting customers into highly specific cohorts. Unlike manual segmentation that relies on assumptions or broad categories, AI builds clusters based on behavior, preferences, geography, and more. Picture an OTT platform analyzing viewing patterns across India. It notices that a family in Delhi prefers Bollywood classics and kids’ cartoons, while a tech-savvy college student in Bangalore binges trending regional dramas. With these insights, the platform doesn’t just push generic recommendations — it curates a viewing experience tailored for each user, boosting satisfaction and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But segmentation doesn’t stop at content. AI also helps businesses refine marketing strategies. For example, targeted promotions for seasonal products or region-specific offers can lead to higher conversion rates. This ability to micro-target ensures no opportunity is left untapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-anticipating-customer-needs&#34;&gt;🔮 Anticipating Customer Needs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI doesn’t just respond to customer behavior — it predicts it. Think of a ride-hailing app that uses AI to forecast demand spikes during festivals or rainy seasons. By analyzing historical data and real-time inputs like weather conditions, the app adjusts its driver allocation and pricing proactively. Customers experience shorter wait times, and drivers benefit from increased demand, creating a win-win scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or imagine an online grocery store predicting when a customer might run out of essentials like milk or bread, based on their purchasing habits. The store can then send timely reminders or offer subscriptions, ensuring the customer never runs out. These proactive measures not only delight users but also build trust and loyalty over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-key-skills-for-product-managers-in-the-ai-era&#34;&gt;🔑 Key Skills for Product Managers in the AI Era&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As AI continues to transform the role of product management, it’s clear that product managers need to evolve alongside it. While AI automates and simplifies many tasks, it also introduces new challenges and opportunities. Embracing this change requires a shift in mindset and a willingness to learn. Let’s discuss the skills that PMs need to stay ahead in this AI-powered world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of a PM is no longer limited to traditional responsibilities like roadmap planning or stakeholder management. Today, PMs must act as the bridge between cutting-edge AI capabilities and real-world user needs. They must learn how to work with AI, use it effectively, and ensure it aligns with the overall product vision. Here are a few skills that I believe are crucial:

		class=&#34;gallery-image&#34; 
		data-flex-grow=&#34;136&#34;
		data-flex-basis=&#34;327px&#34;
	
&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-embrace-data-literacy&#34;&gt;📊 Embrace Data Literacy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data literacy is the foundation of thriving in an AI-driven environment. PMs don’t need to be data scientists, but they must be comfortable interpreting AI outputs and working with data teams. Understanding data structures, metrics, and AI algorithms allows PMs to ask the right questions and make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-cultivate-empathy&#34;&gt;❤️ Cultivate Empathy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While AI excels at analyzing data, it’s up to PMs to ensure decisions remain human-centric. Empathy helps PMs understand the deeper motivations and emotions of users, bridging the gap between data-driven insights and real-world impact. After all, no algorithm can fully replace the intuition and emotional intelligence of a human PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-focus-on-strategy&#34;&gt;🎯 Focus on Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI frees up time, but that time must be spent wisely. Strategic thinking becomes even more critical when AI takes care of routine tasks. PMs must define bold product visions, prioritize high-impact initiatives, and ensure that AI capabilities are aligned with long-term goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-collaborate-with-ai&#34;&gt;🤝 Collaborate with AI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of AI as the ultimate product intern: reliable, efficient, and capable of handling tedious tasks. But just like any intern, AI needs guidance and oversight. PMs should experiment with AI tools, integrate them into workflows, and treat them as collaborative partners rather than replacements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-adaptability-and-curiosity&#34;&gt;🔄 Adaptability and Curiosity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AI landscape evolves rapidly, and PMs must stay curious to keep up. Continuous learning—whether through workshops, online courses, or collaboration with AI teams—ensures that PMs remain equipped to navigate this dynamic environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-conclusion-a-new-era-for-product-management&#34;&gt;💡 Conclusion: A New Era for Product Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI is no longer a futuristic concept; it’s a present reality. By enhancing decision-making, automating tasks, and enabling personalization, it empowers product managers to create extraordinary outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Indian businesses, the potential of AI is immense. With our diverse markets and evolving customer expectations, embracing AI isn’t just an advantage — it’s a necessity. As Marty Cagan says, “The best PMs harness AI not to replace their role, but to elevate it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here’s my question to you: How will you leverage AI to transform your product and create a lasting impact? I’d love to hear your thoughts! 😊&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading! 🙏🏼&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>RRR&#39;s Naatu Naatu wins the Best Original Song at The Oscars!</title>
        <link>https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/rrr/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2023 06:42:24 +0530</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/rrr/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="https://www.arjunuvacha.com/p/rrr/RRR-wins-the-Oscars.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post RRR&#39;s Naatu Naatu wins the Best Original Song at The Oscars!" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;indian-cinema-at-the-oscars&#34;&gt;Indian Cinema at the Oscars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its 110-year-long cinematic journey, it is disheartening to know that a mere 4 ‘Indian’ productions have secured Oscar nominations and NEVER won the coveted award even once, despite being the second largest film industry in the world in the 1950s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been glimmers of recognition in the past but Indian Cinema was majorly ‘unnoticed’ by the outside world until recently. And the worldview of Indian Cinema is changing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after a good 21 years of Amir Khan’s Lagaan, when the team RRR showed up at the Oscars I couldn’t stop cheering and screaming! It was more than what I could take in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the Golden Globes and Critics Choice Awards beating the likes of Lady Gaga, Rihanna, &amp;amp; Taylor Swift for #NaatuNaatu in the Best Original Song Category, it was highly likely that RRR would win at The Academy as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when the result was announced, I transcended into a different world of bliss.
–
There have been a few Indian representatives at the Oscars in the past but they were majorly under ‘international’ productions. And a handful of Indians even won the award: &lt;strong&gt;Bhanu Athaiya, Satyajit Ray, AR Rahman, and Resul Pookutty&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘&lt;strong&gt;Indian&lt;/strong&gt;’ films saw a total of 3 nominations for Best International Feature Film and 1 nomination for Best Documentary Feature so far in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though there have been Indian representations at the Oscars in the past - #RRR winning at the Oscars is such a game changer for the entire Indian movie industry. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rrr---a-game-changer&#34;&gt;RRR - a Game Changer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-indian-movie&#34;&gt;First Indian Movie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RRR is the first ‘Indian movie’ produced by an Indian production house, DVV Entertainment, to win an Oscar in any feature films category, it&amp;rsquo;s unprecedented! (RRR missed another chance for Best International Feature Film - blame IFC if you want!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;huge-market-potential&#34;&gt;Huge market potential&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could open up a HUGE movie market around the world. A lot of new avenues have already been broke open, thanks to SS Rajamouli, but there’s still a long way to go…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total movie market (theatre biz) is more than $42bn (as in 2019, when the business saw the highest numbers). India currently stands in 5th position:&lt;br&gt;
US: $10.5bn&lt;br&gt;
China: $9.3bn&lt;br&gt;
Japan: $2.4bn&lt;br&gt;
France: $1.62bn&lt;br&gt;
India: $1.6bn&lt;br&gt;
South Korea: ~1.6bn&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other major markets beyond these regions, including UK, UAE etc which account to about $7.1bn where Indian movies are actively screened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the box office numbers of all the countries &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://flixpatrol.com/market/box-office-revenues/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, RRR could now be a golden pass for other upcoming Indian movies to capture a piece of this huge market globally where Indian movies are actively screened - opening up a potential $32bn movie market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;increased-budgets-for-upcoming-indian-movies&#34;&gt;Increased budgets for upcoming Indian movies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could also mean an increase in both the size of budgets and the number of big-budget movies coming from India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average budget of the top 10 most expensive Hollywood movies is a staggering $388mn! In comparison, the top 10 Indian movies average at a dismal $45mn - offering a significant gap for increasing investments and making bigger movies. So, the large production houses are bound to get influenced by this Oscars&amp;rsquo; result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;access-to-global-talent&#34;&gt;Access to global talent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the movie budgets and box office numbers don’t excite you if you are more of an ‘art’ person than a ‘commerce’ person, then - this RRR win could open doors to access global artists and global talent, from actors to actresses to technicians for the Indian filmmakers, that could lead to more and more high-quality films coming from India!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, you can only imagine bigger, better, and grander movies coming from India in the future!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-phenomenon-called-ss-rajamouli&#34;&gt;The phenomenon called SS Rajamouli&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A torchbearer, and a pioneer in many ways, SS Rajamouli now leads the path to greater glory for Indian cinema at the world cinema, and has permanently changed the trajectory of Indian cinema!&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Bahubali 1 &amp;amp; 2, he brought the entire film fraternity together - across different languages, transcending boundaries. Now, with RRR he has truly taken Indian Cinema global. From drawing people of the country together to taking the Indian Cinema global, SS Rajamouli is in a league of his own!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His RRR has grossed INR 1200 Cr already and has garnered so much attention, love and thumping responses from audiences around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audience filled the theatres completely whenever the movie was screened in the US and there was a re-release after a re-release multiple times. In fact, it set up a record of getting sold out in a mere 98 seconds when the tickets opened for booking in a 932 seater TCL’s Chinese Theatre in LA. The world was astounded by this craze!&lt;/p&gt;
